            <h2>Family Trees</h2>
            <p>This website provides 274 Whitehouse trees attached to 579 registered correspondents. These trees have been referenced, principally to marriage, census and probate files. To find a tree that might be relevant to your family, use these files. Nearly all the registered correspondents are descendants as indicated by an arrow to their correspondent number, but a few are collaterals of descendants or connected through a marriage.</p>
            
            <p>The trees have been drawn up in MS Excel, using a portrait mode and tall tree format, in which the oldest ancestor appears at the left side and descendants in subsequent columns, moving left to right. To keep this exercise within achievable limits, two rules have normally been followed:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The tree will not usually descend along female lines. That is to say, if Mary Whitehouse marries John Smith and they have children, the tree will normally merely say "Issue" (whether or not they survived infancy).</li>
                <li>The tree will not include any Whitehouse with a date of birth of 1902 or later, unless he or she has a brother or sister born before then, in which case the whole generation of siblings is included along with their spouses (regardless of when the spouse was born). Of course, the children of these siblings do not qualify, because they were born after 1902, but, again, issue of the siblings will be mentioned by the word "Issue", if it is known that they had any.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Exceptions have been made to these rules from time to time to include an additional generation, but no modern generations have been included.</p>
