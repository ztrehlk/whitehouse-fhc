<p class=MsoNormal><u>A trip to Wharf Road</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13th December was an exciting day, as the Society of
Genealogists opened its new premises at 40 Wharf Road.  I was there on the
opening day.  Wharf Road is in a part of London unfamiliar to many.  It is two
bus stops north west of Old Street underground station, off City Road.  Wharf
Road lies adjacent to a Texaco filling station and a MacDonalds drive-thru on
the eastern side of the road.  It's a windy street, being home to many tall
converted warehouses and leads north east towards Regents Canal.  Booking a
visit in advance is required and anything stored off site has to be ordered a
week in advance.  Half a floor below ground level there are a lecture room, reception
desk, lockers and coat pegs.  Two flights of stairs take one down to the
library area, the members' &quot;common room&quot;, toilets and the kitchen. 
The SoG has wisely given up its coffee machine and one can help oneself to free
tea and coffee from the kitchen.  It also has a microwave oven.  Disabled
access to this lower ground floor is by a lift in which one has to keep holding
the button for floor -1 or G.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The library area consists of a straight row of shelves for
books and  further shelving provided by movable racks which economise on space. 
The number of books stored on site has been hugely reduced.  Readers at the
Library of Birmingham, for example, will be familiar with movable racks..  A
limited number of computers are bookable in advance, to help those coming from
afar.  One can also bring in a laptop and thereby access most of the records available
on the SoG's computers via a wifi link. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that said, the basement floor including the library area
is not yet fully operational.  Adjustable chairs are on order.  Fiches have not
yet been retrieved from offsite storage.  The present scanning machine cannot
satisfactorily be used on films that require high magnification and a new one
is on order.  There are problems with heating (the library area gets too hot in
the afternoon).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress with Whitehouse records</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am pleased to report 13 months of
steady progress towards improving this website to make it fitter for
archiving.  There have been five main projects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(1) Combining and revising three
very large trees; this has finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(2) Revising the 1851 census file,
a task taken on by Brian Strehlke, my friend and collaborator from Scotts
Valley, California, with a much smaller amount of input from me; this is nearly
finished.  He has done a great job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(3) Normalising forenames and
altering the layout of the 1881 census file, to make it consistent with our
work on the 1911 and 1851 censuses; this is ongoing, but well advanced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(4) Revising the new (online) GRO
(England &amp; Wales) index of births, which is very time-consuming and has temporarily
stalled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(5) Extending coverage of black
country baptisms, particularly by creating a single file for the whole of
Dudley Registration District, adding Wednesbury and improving West Bromwich. 
In the course of the last-mentioned, I have been greatly assisted by Peter
Loach, who has been researching at Smethwick (the Sandwell Community History
and Archive Service).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(6) A  project to improve the
main GRO (England &amp; Wales) marriage file by finding or inferring spouses,
and where appropriate entering full or partial details in the Marriage Details
file, has been completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Commenting on these projects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(1) A website tree was carefully
drawn up by my correspondent, but without recourse to this website, where my
marriage details file would have shown that he had made some bad assumptions
and as a result inserted the wrong spouses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(2) Currently, Brian is checking
subscription databases to see whether there are any omissions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(3) It has been our policy when
revising the 1851 and 1911 censuses to try to provide forenames in place of
initials or blanks.  It requires investigation.   Normalisation also means that
we no longer accept abbreviations such as Wm, Edward or Thos, in order to
facilitate searching.  Odd-looking surnames are also checked.  The 1881 census
is in the process of retro-normalisation.  In the 1911 census, I have reversed
the normalisation of Florrie etc. to Florence where Florrie is the name
registered at birth.  This has resulted in 11 denormalisations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(4) There are hundreds of errors
in mother's maiden surnames.  Some might be the result of careless data
processing during the GRO's project, but many discrepancies occur for the
probable reason that people could not read and the registrar wrote the name as
it sounded to him.  The interesting question arises: what is the
&quot;correct&quot; surname ?  I take it to be the name registered at birth,
failing that at baptism and failing both these at marriage.  A difficulty that
occasionally arises is that the parents do not later accept the name at baptism
or even at marriage, repeatedly using the &quot;wrong&quot; name.  So one has
to adopt some flexibility.  The important thing is to try to ascribe to
everyone in the same family the same mother's maiden surname.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many Whitehouse births apparently missing from the
new (online) GRO (England &amp; Wales) index.  I sent to the GRO for
investigation a sample of these, from 1860 4th quarter, where searches under
Whitehouse failed to reveal any entry, one in Bromsgrove Registration District
(RD), one in Kings Norton RD and 18 in Dudley RD.  Back came a typical
bureaucratic and unclear reply &quot;Indexed data not available&quot;. 
Presumably they were missed when the new index was constructed, but the
original certificates must be there.  To prove it, I ordered successfully a
.pdf of one of them.  One cannot order the much cheaper .jpg as this only
operates from the new index.  It would seem that the GRO don't have the staff
resources to look up the missing entries and put them online.  I have found a
total of 76 Whitehouse entries missing from the new index.  Anyhow, I have
written them a letter, which calls for a proper reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(5) I hope to work on Oldbury, but have been held up by the
Society of Genealogists who hold microfiche of the parish register, but have
not yet removed microfiches from offsite storage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(6) Here are the updated statistics on the WFHC Whitehouse
marriage files:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Total marriages in England &amp; Wales (1837Q3 to 1911):
8875</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with full details (&quot;f&quot;): 7389 (83.26%)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with partial details (&quot;p&quot;): 56 (0.63%)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with only a small amount of details (&quot;s&quot;):
10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with an assigned spouse: 8744 (97.54%) in England
&amp; Wales; overall (all British Isles): 8744 (98.52%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coggeshall is a village between Chelmsford and Colchester on
the old A120.  <span style='background:white'>The saying &quot;A Coggeshall

or pointless piece of work, after the reputed stupidity of its villagers. There
were numerous stories of the inhabitants' ridiculous endeavours, such as
