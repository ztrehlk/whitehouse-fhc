font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The Inland Revenue Board of Stamps ledgers are
preserved at The National Archives, Kew, under the class IR 1.  In more detail,
the government imposed stamp duty from 1710 to 1810 on certain apprenticeship
indentures. The ledgers are the original record: the indentures have not been
retained.  They show the date of the indenture, the apprentice s names, his
(sometimes her) father s name in most entries up to 1750, sometimes with an
address, the master s name, his trade and address, the price paid to the master
and the term for which the apprenticeship was to run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The IR 1 piece numbers run consecutively in two
series,  town  and  country .  The names are slightly misleading, as the town registers
record those in which the stamp duty was paid to the Stamp Office in London,
no matter where the apprenticeship was to be served.  The  town  pieces are
numbered 1-40 and dated from October 1711 to January 1811, with gaps (a) before
October 1711, (b) between August 1721 and  January 1722  (presumed 1723 in the
Gregorian calendar), (c)  March 1726  to  March 1729  and (d) August 1733 to
April 1735.  The IR 1  country  pieces are 41-72, running from May 1710 to
September 1808, with gaps (e) from  January 1725  to November 1728, (f) from
November 1731 to April 1741, (g) from April 1745 to October 1749 and (h) from
March to August 1784. It appears therefore that quite a few of the registers
have gone missing and the Public Record Office, as it was then known, merely
numbered the survivors with consecutive piece numbers.  The years referred to
are those when the indenture was stamped and recorded in the ledger, which is <u>not</u>
the date of the indenture or the date from which the term of apprenticeship was
to run.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Apprentice boys were normally bound to their
master for 7 years, usually starting at age 14, but some were younger,
especially if their father had died.  Fewer girls were apprenticed.  Stamp duty
was payable on the  premium , which was the term for the amount paid by the
parent to the apprentice master.  The master had to pay the duty, which was at

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The reason that so few entries appear for
Whitehouse is doubtless that only privately arranged apprenticeships were
dutiable and then only if a premium was paid.  Parish apprenticeships were also
excluded from duty.  These were for children in the workhouse or from families
receiving poor law relief, for example those in Wednesbury parish mentioned in
my newsletter of 2nd July 2010.  The two Wednesbury parish apprenticeships
found are typical, in that the children were sent to other parishes, here Manchester and Dudley. The reason for this was that once an apprentice had served his
master for 40 days, he could gain settlement in his parish of employment, so if
the apprenticeship terminated, he might again become a burden on the parish s
relief funds.  It was therefore advantageous for one parish to arrange an
apprenticeship in another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The ledgers use many abbreviations of forenames
and occupations. These have been  normalised  in this WFHC transcript by
expanding the abbreviations and correcting spelling.  In this WFHC indexed
transcript, the arrangement is by the date of the indenture with dates before
1752 in the old (Julian) calendar translated into the modern (Gregorian)
calendar.  This date is often many months earlier than the date of payment of
the tax and still earlier than the ledger date.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>To identify Whitehouse apprentices and masters,
the indexes used initially were those made between the wars by the Society of
Genealogists (SoG), which covered 1710 to 1774.  The SoG indexes are
magnificent for the time at which they were made, but are not error-free:  8
entries had to be rejected as clearly Whitehorn(e).  In 2011,  Ancestry 
indexed the whole 100-year range.  The  Ancestry  index contained two
additional entries not in the SoG index, but they turned out to be a Whitehorne
and a Whitbread.  It was used to continue the work from 1774 to the end date,
which for Whitehouses was 1807.  Many errors in the  Ancestry  index have been
corrected in the present work, which provides all the information in the ledger
except for the ledger date, which is not considered genealogically relevant.</span></p>

reconciled with trade directories of the time.  The Whitehouse entries for each
year were extracted in the order of appearance in the books.  Years 1787-92,
1801-02 and 1806-10 have complete extraction of Whitehouse tenants in all the quarters
(districts) of the town.  For all other years up to 1816, extraction is
complete for only the St Mary quarter which is at the heart of Birmingham s
gun-making industry.  Whitehouse landlords are not covered in the extraction
programme up to 1816, but one was noticed and has been entered.  Years 1794 to
1797 and 1798 to 1801 are not yet extracted, even in part.  For 1816 onwards,
on the other hand, Whitehouse tenants and landlords are covered. Coverage for
1816-20 is complete, 1820-23 is limited to the following districts: St Mary,
Bull St, Dale End, St Paul &amp; Digbeth, 1823-27 to St Mary District only

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Column  OO  shows the original order of the
entries in the rate books.  The year refers to the rating year 26th March 1787
to 25th March (Lady Day) 1788 and so on.  The  Quarter  refers to sub-divisions
of the town into districts.  In each year the order of listing of the quarters
in the rate books varied.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>For 1787-92, there are two columns of rate
entries per page, which are shown here as left (L) and right (R).  The books
list enumerators  walks in the form  Bull Street from Snow Hill , meaning that
the order of the households is as one walks from Snow Hill at the north eastern
end of Bull Street to the High Street at its south western end.  It appears in
many cases that the two sides of the street were walked separately.  In this
database, the walk has been abbreviated to show merely the street enumerated,
i.e. in this case Bull Street.  The books for 1787-92 show these walks in main
headings, but there are also sub-headings.  These appear to indicate where
other streets meet or intersect the street being walked.  It is not entirely
clear whether the enumerator has walked into these side streets: the passage
from Slaney Street to Weaman Street is an example, as the passage sometimes
appears as a main heading.  The 1792-1800 books are similar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The 1801-02 book has a different layout.  The
pages are not divided into columns, but, unfortunately, the page numbers are
seldom visible on the film until page 418.  However, the book shows a schedule
number for each house.  This appears to be an arbitrary number, which does not
necessarily coincide with real house numbers.  This number and an indication of
whether it is a front (F) or back (B) house have taken the place of the page
and column numbers used for 1787-92.  Unfortunately, on occasions, the numbering
system has started afresh for the same street, so it is not an unambiguous way
of identifying a particular entry.  However, page numbers have come to the
rescue in the one instance affecting Whitehouses (in Hockley).  The streets are
merely listed as such in the books, without showing any starting points for the
enumerators  walks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The forenames of Whitehouses are frequently
shown as abbreviations and so have been  normalised  (written out in full). 
Premises can generally be assumed to be a house unless otherwise stated,
although in 1801-02 most enumerators listed them as such.  For 1787-92 any rate
paid is shown in the notes, while for 1801-02 and subsequent years a rateable
value (RV) is shown.  The rates paid seem at first sight rather odd, that for
1788-89 being 12 times that for 1787-88, but maybe those for the earlier year
are per month.  It matters little, as the main purpose in showing the rate paid
or rateable value is to indicate the size of the property, shops, warehouses
etc. normally having a much higher rateable value than houses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The 1802-10 and 1810-16 books are, again,
slightly different in their format, the street sub-headings and the column
showing whether a front or a back house no longer appearing.  That for 1806-08
appears to have been used for 1808-10 as well and so has been re-labelled
accordingly in this database.  Gardens are rated for the first time in 1806, as
it seems to have been the practice for those living in the populous gun quarter
to rent gardens a little further away. The Street refers to where the renter of
the Garden lived, not where the garden is located.  Oddly, the garden renters
are not always found in these streets.  Several errors in the rate books have
been detected and there appear to be many omissions.  1801-02 seems to have
been a particularly stringent year for rate collection, probably being
connected in some way with the 1801 population census.  The 1816-20 book is
particularly useful since the house numbers appear to be the same as found in
directories.  One might call this book the first full street directory of
Birmingham.</span></p>

held for long periods, so it has been estimated that 75% of the total number of

against the first line of the event.  The appearance of a Whitehouse as an
executor in the will of a person of different surname could throw up
interesting questions.  For example, why was Richard Whitehouse of Handsworth,
the Birmingham gun engraver, an executor of the will of William Marsh of
Oldbury ?  He is no known relative and Richard never lived in Oldbury. </span></p>

history of lunatic asylums.  The few asylums built in the 18th century were
charitably funded.  The Lunatics Act of 1808 permitted county magistrates to
fund new asylums from the rates, but only about 20 were built before 1845, when
the Lunacy Act and County Asylums Acts were passed.  The Lunacy Act established
a Commission responsible for inspecting and visiting asylums and laid down
procedures for the admission and care of patients.  These Acts set in train the
proper provision of care for the mentally defective and by 1914 there were 102
asylums housing 108,000 patients.  Surprisingly, the new asylums were modelled
on the country house estate.  They were grand, spacious, airy buildings, often
in an elevated position, with extensive grounds, often in a rural setting.  The
Lunacy Commissioners demanded that land should be provided for exercise,
recreation, gardening etc.  By the early 20th century, however, the early
reformers  aims of respite, rehabilitation, recovery and release had been
severely compromised by overcrowding, high staff turnover (owing to poor pay
and difficult working conditions), reductions in specialist care etc.  Much

but page 3 contains a statement of the principle of the invention, which is to
heat the tubes of iron (the metal sheet bent into tubular shape) nearly to the
point of fusion, withdraw them from the fire and pass them through dies or holes,
by which the edges of the heated iron may be pressed together, and the joint
firmly welded. The patent was printed in 1857 and a copy is provided here as </span><a

specification was not retained and so is not available. I have therefore

1831, the British Post Office kept a register of every employee, which
continued to 1959.  These registers, which  are available on
&quot;Ancestry&quot;, give the name, date of appointment to the Post Office,

register contains many abbreviations.  In the WFHC file, those which are clear
have been translated into words, while others have been given suggested
explanations in square brackets.  Those for which there is no obviously likely
meaning have been left as they stand in the register. The minutes up to 1855
are stamped &quot;Minute cancelled: see Decision in 5th Schedule&quot;.  It is
not known what this means, but it is suspected that they have merely been
amalgamated into a tidy schedule.  Thereafter, the register has a column for
minutes appointing the employee and another column for minutes confirming the
appointment.  It is assumed that the confirmation takes place only when the
person concerned becomes a permanent employee and is paid a salary.  However,
this needs clarification.  In 1909, the register was re-drawn to show only one
column which appears to take the place of the previous confirmation column.  A
few of the appointments have been reconciled with the pensions and gratuities

and gratuity records of the British Post Office are found in the Royal Mail
Archive, housed within The Postal Museum in London.  In the early days of the
Post Office, pensions records were kept for senior or clerical grades.  Few
postmen received a pension and those that did were often hardship cases.  These
records begin 1719 and are in Treasury Letter Books, recording correspondence
with the Treasury.  They are classified as &quot;POST1&quot;.   After the
Superannuation Act of 1859 all employees were entitled to a pension, subject to
diligent and faithful service.  A standard form was completed and sent to the
Treasury, giving name, job description, place of work, type of award (pension,
gratuity) etc., age, length of service, salary and emoluments.  Many female
employees were given a gratuity when they left the service to marry.</span></p>

there are no good indexes to these records.  There is a list of name, job
description and place, in the original date order, which continues until 1959. 
This index is then used to access the book of Treasury Letters, which needs to
be ordered from storage, but production is very quick.  Frequently, these
&quot;letters&quot; are no more than forms in which the Post Office recommended
to the Treasury the grant of a pension or gratuity and the Treasury acceded.  </span></p>

1896 onwards, the chronological indexes have been further indexed in separate,
batched calendars, which have to be consulted on microfilm to find the month of
the award.  It is then necessary to consult a third, paper, index to identify
the relevant book of Treasury Letters.  In short, these calendars and indexes
are difficult to use, but still better than having no index at all.</span></p>

Janet Rowley, a WFHC correspondent, now deceased.  She kindly provided her
Whitehouse data, which I have transferred to a spreadsheet and indexed to make
it searchable by name.  The period covered is 1614-1803. The Lord of the Manor
had legal jurisdiction, devolved from the Crown, and held Court sessions for
dealing with criminal and civil matters.  Civil matters frequently related to
land transactions and probate.  The tenants of the Lord held land under the legal
status of copyhold (so called because the tenancy was recorded in the court
rolls and the tenant was given a copy).   Rents were low, being fixed by custom
of the Manor, but when land changed hands, it was described as surrendered. 
The Lord levied a large  fine  on the new tenant, effectively a one-off
registration fee for his admission to the Manor.   Copyhold was valuable
because there was a right of inheritance attached to it, but death of the
copyholder caused a surrender.  More about the Manorial system can be found in

at Epiphany (early January), Easter,  Translation , which means midsummer
(July) and Michaelmas (October).  However, there became too many cases to be
handled at these sessions, so additional  adjourned  sessions were added.  The
main adjournments were to the Epiphany and Translation sessions.  To enable a
proper order to be maintained in the WFHC file, each session and adjourned
session was allotted a Session Number ( SN ) from 1 to 8 in Column D of the file. 
When the numbers being tried grew, case numbers were allotted.  Eventually,
crimes were separated into felonies and misdemeanours, separate lists and case
numbers being established for each from 1835 onwards.  The main felony was
theft, while the main misdemeanours were obtaining by false pretences, assaults
and breaches of the peace.  Misdemeanour cases are marked with the letter  M 
against the case number on Column E: the other cases are all felonies.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;

from the Bedfordshire Record Office s website:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'> In the fourteenth century the word indictment was a technical
expression for a written accusation which was not an appeal by an individual
but the outcome of a solemn enquiry into the committing of offences. The
indictment became the usual way of beginning criminal proceedings. In the case
of misdemeanours tried at Quarter Sessions this could be the criminal
information laid by a single individual rather than a presenting jury.
Informations by private persons were encouraged by legislation, from the mid
fifteenth century onwards, as a means of suppressing economic offences, with
the informer being allowed a share of the penalty fine imposed on the criminal.
Unfortunately this encouraged a breed known as 'common informers' who made a
living by prying and accepting such awards. Indictments are written in Latin up
to 1733, after which they may be written in English or Latin.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Those
against whom a bill of indictment (that is, a formal criminal charge) had been
made were first placed before a grand jury, whose function was to hear evidence
for the Crown. If it was decided that there was a case to be answered by the
accused, the indictment was declared to be a  true bill  (billa vera); if not
it was  no bill  (ignoramus)[meaning we do not know]. In the former case, the
accused then went forward to a full trial. The grand jury procedure was
abolished in 1933.   Nowadays,  not a true bill  would be a case which was not
proceeded with owing to lack of evidence, i.e. no case to answer.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>The language of the details of the trial is inconsistent and
sometimes prolix.  In this file, it has been abbreviated.   Hard labour  meant
imprisonment, with treadmill punishment.  Treadmills were large, up to 30 feet
long and 6 feet high, with treads set about 9 inches apart.  This ensured that
each prisoner had to keep moving quite quickly or risk falling and injury.  The
prisoners were separated from each other by wooden partitions and talking was
not allowed.   They could grab hold of chains, but there was no other support. 
They had to tread the mill for about a quarter of an hour, before a short break
was allowed.  One commentator says 16 minutes with a break of 8 minutes, but
practices probably varied between prisons.  In Stafford, it took place in the
 House of Correction , which was separate from the county gaol from 1793
onwards.  In 1834 a new one was built.  References to the House of Correction
have not been included in the WFHC file, as it was felt that absence of one in
many cases did not mean that the punishment took place elsewhere.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>Children were treated relatively mercifully, to a whipping in
private and a short period of hard labour.  However, in general, the
correlation between the crime recorded and the punishment meted out is
difficult to understand and probably depended partly on the particular
magistrates, previous criminal record and demeanour in the trial.  There were a
few cases of young men being whipped, but this was rare.</span></p>
