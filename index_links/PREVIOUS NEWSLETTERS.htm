<p class=MsoNormal><u>A trip to Wharf Road</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13th December was an exciting day, as the Society of
Genealogists opened its new premises at 40 Wharf Road.  I was there on the
opening day.  Wharf Road is in a part of London unfamiliar to many.  It is two
bus stops north west of Old Street underground station, off City Road.  Wharf
Road lies adjacent to a Texaco filling station and a MacDonalds drive-thru on
the eastern side of the road.  It's a windy street, being home to many tall
converted warehouses and leads north east towards Regents Canal.  Booking a
visit in advance is required and anything stored off site has to be ordered a
week in advance.  Half a floor below ground level there are a lecture room, reception
desk, lockers and coat pegs.  Two flights of stairs take one down to the
library area, the members' &quot;common room&quot;, toilets and the kitchen. 
The SoG has wisely given up its coffee machine and one can help oneself to free
tea and coffee from the kitchen.  It also has a microwave oven.  Disabled
access to this lower ground floor is by a lift in which one has to keep holding
the button for floor -1 or G.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The library area consists of a straight row of shelves for
books and  further shelving provided by movable racks which economise on space. 
The number of books stored on site has been hugely reduced.  Readers at the
Library of Birmingham, for example, will be familiar with movable racks..  A
limited number of computers are bookable in advance, to help those coming from
afar.  One can also bring in a laptop and thereby access most of the records available
on the SoG's computers via a wifi link. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that said, the basement floor including the library area
is not yet fully operational.  Adjustable chairs are on order.  Fiches have not
yet been retrieved from offsite storage.  The present scanning machine cannot
satisfactorily be used on films that require high magnification and a new one
is on order.  There are problems with heating (the library area gets too hot in
the afternoon).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress with Whitehouse records</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am pleased to report 13 months of
steady progress towards improving this website to make it fitter for
archiving.  There have been five main projects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(1) Combining and revising three
very large trees; this has finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(2) Revising the 1851 census file,
a task taken on by Brian Strehlke, my friend and collaborator from Scotts
Valley, California, with a much smaller amount of input from me; this is nearly
finished.  He has done a great job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(3) Normalising forenames and
altering the layout of the 1881 census file, to make it consistent with our
work on the 1911 and 1851 censuses; this is ongoing, but well advanced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(4) Revising the new (online) GRO
(England &amp; Wales) index of births, which is very time-consuming and has temporarily
stalled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(5) Extending coverage of black
country baptisms, particularly by creating a single file for the whole of
Dudley Registration District, adding Wednesbury and improving West Bromwich. 
In the course of the last-mentioned, I have been greatly assisted by Peter
Loach, who has been researching at Smethwick (the Sandwell Community History
and Archive Service).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(6) A  project to improve the
main GRO (England &amp; Wales) marriage file by finding or inferring spouses,
and where appropriate entering full or partial details in the Marriage Details
file, has been completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Commenting on these projects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(1) A website tree was carefully
drawn up by my correspondent, but without recourse to this website, where my
marriage details file would have shown that he had made some bad assumptions
and as a result inserted the wrong spouses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(2) Currently, Brian is checking
subscription databases to see whether there are any omissions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(3) It has been our policy when
revising the 1851 and 1911 censuses to try to provide forenames in place of
initials or blanks.  It requires investigation.   Normalisation also means that
we no longer accept abbreviations such as Wm, Edward or Thos, in order to
facilitate searching.  Odd-looking surnames are also checked.  The 1881 census
is in the process of retro-normalisation.  In the 1911 census, I have reversed
the normalisation of Florrie etc. to Florence where Florrie is the name
registered at birth.  This has resulted in 11 denormalisations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(4) There are hundreds of errors
in mother's maiden surnames.  Some might be the result of careless data
processing during the GRO's project, but many discrepancies occur for the
probable reason that people could not read and the registrar wrote the name as
it sounded to him.  The interesting question arises: what is the
&quot;correct&quot; surname ?  I take it to be the name registered at birth,
failing that at baptism and failing both these at marriage.  A difficulty that
occasionally arises is that the parents do not later accept the name at baptism
or even at marriage, repeatedly using the &quot;wrong&quot; name.  So one has
to adopt some flexibility.  The important thing is to try to ascribe to
everyone in the same family the same mother's maiden surname.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many Whitehouse births apparently missing from the
new (online) GRO (England &amp; Wales) index.  I sent to the GRO for
investigation a sample of these, from 1860 4th quarter, where searches under
Whitehouse failed to reveal any entry, one in Bromsgrove Registration District
(RD), one in Kings Norton RD and 18 in Dudley RD.  Back came a typical
bureaucratic and unclear reply &quot;Indexed data not available&quot;. 
Presumably they were missed when the new index was constructed, but the
original certificates must be there.  To prove it, I ordered successfully a
.pdf of one of them.  One cannot order the much cheaper .jpg as this only
operates from the new index.  It would seem that the GRO don't have the staff
resources to look up the missing entries and put them online.  I have found a
total of 76 Whitehouse entries missing from the new index.  Anyhow, I have
written them a letter, which calls for a proper reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(5) I hope to work on Oldbury, but have been held up by the
Society of Genealogists who hold microfiche of the parish register, but have
not yet removed microfiches from offsite storage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(6) Here are the updated statistics on the WFHC Whitehouse
marriage files:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Total marriages in England &amp; Wales (1837Q3 to 1911):
8875</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with full details (&quot;f&quot;): 7389 (83.26%)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with partial details (&quot;p&quot;): 56 (0.63%)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with only a small amount of details (&quot;s&quot;):
10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number with an assigned spouse: 8744 (97.54%) in England
&amp; Wales; overall (all British Isles): 8744 (98.52%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 1st

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A happy new year to both my
readers!   Seriously, feedback is always welcome and especially from anyone,
other than Brian and Gary, who actually reads this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='color:black'><span style='text-decoration:
 none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='color:black'>WFHC NEWS</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I have revised the &quot;official&quot;
birth, death and marriage files in the surname Whitehouse drastically, by
creating single files for each covering the statutory registers (SR) for the
whole of the British Isles (BI) up to 1911.  The file names begin B BI SR....,
M BI SR.... and D BI SR.... followed by the date in yymmdd order.  For those
unfamiliar with the geographical nomenclature:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Great Britain = England, Wales
&amp; Scotland</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>United Kingdom = England, Wales,
Scotland &amp; Ireland (up to 1922, thereafter Northern Ireland)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>British Isles = The United Kingdom
plus the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are crown dependencies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Deviant spellings of the surname
have been incorporated, with a note to that effect.  After this exercise, many
files have been deleted, thus simplifying the website.  The file &quot;BMD
Explanations&quot; has undergone great revision, with detailed explanations of
the statutory registers largely deleted.  I have also removed a file of
marriages for the forename Whitehouse, having become unconvinced that it is of
any use.  When people marry they do not necessarily register all their
forenames anyway.  Also disappearing are the three entries from the Civil
Service Evidence of Age records, which has been replaced by notes in the 1851,
1881 and 1911 censuses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a further improvement, I have
begun to compare the new GRO Births Index with the old, adding the mother's
maiden name (MMS).  I have completed 1837 (1st July) to the end of 1851.  I am
sorry to report that the new index contains many errors and there are a
significant number of entries, 41 so far, not found in the new index, 25 of
them in 1838.  A particular difficulty here is that entering the surname is
compulsory, but there is no wild card facility for searching it.  Another
significant discrepancy lies in the page numbers in the new index, some of
which are so far removed from reality that they relate to another registration
district!  Where a surname or forename appears outstandingly unlikely, I have
investigated.  One of those in my own tree, MMS Tantam, has suffered badly and
it is fortunate that I have been able to correct it.   I aim to carry on with
this work, experimenting with the aid of a file sent to me many years ago by a
mysterious benefactor &quot;RiverofStars&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There is a small new file added,
West Bromwich cemetery burials for 1863-1876.  Sadly, I do not know who sent me
this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Meanwhile, I am very pleased that
my friend and collaborator, Brian Strehlke, has started to correct the WFHC
transcript of Whitehouse households in the 1851 census and I am checking it. 
We are adopting 1911 census type of improvements, as far as relevant, which
means that names are being lightly normalised to make searching easier.  <span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The normalisation has taken place as follows:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>(1) where
there is an obvious misspelling: for example, Elizibith and Lousia are rendered
as Elizabeth and Louisa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>(2) where an
abbreviated name has been used: for example, Chas, Tom and Wm. have been
expanded.  Carrie, Fred, Florrie and Millie have been considered abbreviated
names for Caroline, Frederick, Florence and Millicent and normalised.  However,
Florrie could be the familiar name for Flora, rather than Florence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>(3)  three
other forenames:  Phoebe, Selina and Susannah, which have been rendered in
several different spellings (Pheobe, Phebey etc., Celina, Selena etc. and
Susan(n)a).  However, Susan has been left un-normalised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>Examples of <u>un</u>-normalised
names comprise Ann/Anna/Anne/Annie; Betsy/Betsey; Harriet with one  t  and
Lizzie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When I see an entry transcribed by
&quot;Ancestry&quot; as Whetchonse, which is almost unsearchable, I become even
more convinced of the value of this census project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Being out of inspiration for my
usual tailpiece, I looked online and found this from an American:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I went searching for an ancestor. I cannot find him
still.<br>
He moved around from place to place and did not leave a will.<br>
He married where a courthouse burned. He mended all his fences.<br>
He avoided any man who came to take the US census. <br>
He always kept his luggage packed, this man who had no fame.<br>
And every 20 years or so, this rascal changed his name.<br>
His parents came from Europe. They could be upon some list<br>
of passengers to the USA, but somehow they got missed. <br>
And no one else in the world is searching for this man<br>
So, I play geneasolitaire to find him if I can. <br>
I'm told he's buried in a plot, with tombstone he was blessed<br>
but the weather took engraving and some vandals took the rest, <br>
He died before the county clerks decided to keep records,<br>
No family bible has emerged in spite of all my efforts. <br>
To top it off this ancestor, who caused me many groans. <br>
Just to give me one more pain, betrothed a girl named JONES.&quot;</p>

revise the file of households containing at least one Whitehouse in this census
has been declared finished.  I am immensely indebted to Brian Strehlke for his
majority contribution to this joint project.  He has done great work as to quality
and quantity.  Our transcript has been checked against both
&quot;Ancestry&quot; and &quot;Findmypast&quot;.  Where doubts have arisen
through illegibility, especially of surnames, we have investigated.  Where the
relationship to head of household has been left unstated in the return or
merely described as &quot;Relative&quot; (RE in our symbolism), we have tried
to discover it and added a note. All in all, this WFHC transcript is probably
the most accurate, most complete and most helpful that will be found anywhere.

paper.  When a page was full, they started another one at what, at the time,
was the end of the register.  That resulted in many well separated pages of
surnames beginning with frequent letters, such as &quot;W&quot;.  The second
series, from 1760 to 1838 was calendered more sensibly, but there were few
entries in this period.  Anyhow, the result was totally negative for
Whitehouses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>I have been contemplating a project to augment WFHC birth
registrations with the mother's maiden surname (MMS).  A major problem is mis-transcriptions
within the index.  For example, that given for Grace Sarah WHITEHOUSE
registered in the last quarter of 1895 at Wolverhampton 6b 663 is TALAM,
whereas it is really TATAM, the second &quot;T&quot; presumably not having been
crossed properly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>Nevertheless, my correspondent Liz Smit, has kindly worked on the
year 1866, adding the mother's maiden surname (MMS) for the year 1866 and
second and third forenames, which in 1866 were not indexed, initials only being
given.  Many thanks to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>GRO birth registrations were the subject of an article by Else
Churchill in &quot;Genealogists' Magazine&quot;, September 2022 (Vol, 34 No. 3)
published by the Society of Genealogists.  In it she gives 25 top tips and
techniques suggested by others.  There are too many to re-publish here, but I
have selected five:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>&quot;6.  Check the date of registration.  If exactly 6 weeks
after the date of birth provided, then the date of birth may have been
'adjusted' to avoid a penalty for late registration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>&quot;12.  A maiden name for registration purposes is the name in
which a woman first contracted marriage, so it's not always the same as the
name she was born with, e.g. she might be adopted, taking a stepfather's name
or changed her name prior to marriage.  By the GRO definition, an unmarried woman
has no maiden name, which is reflected in the revised GRO online indexes.&quot;
[but actually, the mother's surname is often used]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>&quot;16.  The first child may be registered in a different
registration district than where the couple are living, and subsequent children
born, as first-time mothers often returned to their own mother's residence to
give birth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>&quot;20.  Most of what seem to be late registrations are in fact
re-registrations, sometimes years after the birth, for a number of reasons</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>- on the instructions of the Registrar General because fraud has
been detected</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>- to legitimise a child born to unmarried persons (after 1926)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>- to add the name of an unmarried father not named in the original
registration (after 1956).&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>&quot;22.  Use FreeBMD and its wild card search parameters to
reduce the number of entries and then confirm using the GRO indexes' search
functionality.  Neither system is perfect but combining them works well.&quot;</span></p>

color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>The Fleet marriages file (new to the WFHC)
shows 30 Whitehouses in the registers of the Fleet Prison Chapel and other
Chapels in London where clandestine marriages took place.  They were conducted
by an ordained priest, without banns or licence, an advantage to those who
wished to hide their marriage from public view. The registers, some of which
were in notebook form, were kept by the officiating priest, but many are
copies.  Where the details given differ, it is difficult to know which register
to believe.  This WFHC transcript shows the major variations.  Such clandestine
marriages led to the 1753 Hardwicke Act banning them from 25th March 1754 and
prescribing the information that had to be given in parish registers.  Although
the marriages took place in London, this was not necessarily the residence of
the parties.  A feature of these marriages is that many give residence
information of the parties, their marital condition and the man's occupation.
Chapman code abbreviations for counties have been used in this transcript and
forenames have been normalised.</span></p>

Whitehouse GRO Marriages 1837Q3 to 1911 have taken another leap forward. 
Firstly, Peter Loach has kindly contributed another 37 marriages with details,
to which I have added 7.  I have carried out a reconciliation, greatly aided by
my daughter who is a whizz at this sort of thing, rectified omissions and removed
duplicates, so that as of 5th October 2021, there were 7406 marriages with at
least some detail extracted from church registers, certificates etc.  which is
83.45% of the revised total of 8875.  Of these, 7347 (82.78%) have the
&quot;full&quot; detail, meaning everything except names of officiating
clergymen and/or registrar and, in some instances, the number of the entry in
the register.  Another 50 (0.60%) have partial detail, meaning at least the
names of the fathers of the groom and bride and the date and place of the
marriage.  Also included are 9 marriages with less detail than that.  The three
categories are marked &quot;f&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; in the GRO
M 1837-1911 file.  To get the details, just note the Universal Number (UN) in
the far left column and look up this number in the GRO M DETAILS file. 
Meanwhile, the number of marriages with identified spouses has increased to a
total of 8505 (95.83%).  Because of the duplication between UN358 and 359, the
latter has been deleted and all marriages from UN360 onwards moved back by one
number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Today
is a birthday in the history of my information service, for it began on 1st
April 1981 and is therefore 40 years old.  Never mind the history, though, as
it's also an important milestone in improving the website.  For some years I
have been wanting to get rid of my complex method of indexing correspondents'
trees and at long last I have done so.  While trees will continue to have
arrows pointing to the line of descent of the correspondent, they will be
indexed by the tree number.  Where a tree has more than one correspondent
attached to it, the tree number is that of the lowest correspondent number. 
For example, tree 050 has correspondents 050, 214, 331 and 474 attached to it. 
It is now indexed as 050 alone.  So in an 1871 census entry the reference to
214 and 474 has been replaced by 050.   The tree number can be found from the
Correspondent Key file (link on the index page).  In this key, there are two
columns, one showing &quot;WFHC No.&quot; (the correspondent number) and the
other showing the numbers of all correspondents.  For example, if correspondent
214 looks up that number, he will find listed 050 214 331 and 474 and know that
his tree number is 050, being the lowest.  To achieve this has not been simple,
for it has involved laying out the index columns of more than 30 files and
changing them all in a single set of operations.  As there are many trees
awaiting revision, which will generate further indexing, especially for the
1911 census, this seemingly bureaucratic exercise will save time later.</span></p>

area of progress has been my marriage records for England &amp; Wales covering
1st July 1837 to 1911.  Unexpectedly and very kindly, Peter Loach, with whom I
have been collaborating to publicise some of his work, has dug out some
marriage details for me.  I have also done some research to uncover spouses of
Whitehouses.  In the result there are 7301 marriages for which all the
essential details are provided in my Marriage Details file, which amount to
over 82%.  There are 50 more with partial details.  The GRO (General Register
Office, England &amp; Wales) Marriages file is now over 95% complete with

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
mysterious affair at Syleham</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I
mentioned this item in the January newsletter, but have a bit more to add to
the story.  When researching my own Whitehouse family history, I investigated
the marriage of Jonathan Smith to Ellen Sowter, on 29th October 1869 in the
parish church of Syleham in Suffolk.  The GRO certificate obtained showed the
marriage in 1869 as entry No 91 in the church register.  The original register,
which had remained in the church, agreed.  This is a small village with few
marriages and entry 92 was a marriage occurring nearly a year later on 18th
October 1870 between Edward Rush and Anna Amelia Steggall.  Searching the GRO
index for these marriages shows <u>both</u> registered in the 4th quarter 1870
!   Many errors have been found in the GRO's records of marriages, causing
Michael Whitfield Foster to write two books on the subject &quot;A Comedy of
Errors or The Marriage Records of England and Wales 1837-1899&quot;, published
in 1998 and &quot;A Comedy of Errors - Act Two&quot;, published in 2002.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
unforgotten</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Thomas
Henry Whitehouse married in 1898, the GRO reference being 1898 Dec (Q4)
Southwark St Olave 1d 544.  Using the publicly available &quot;Marriage
Locator&quot; available to the public from the Guild of One-name Studies, it
can be seen that this marriage took place at the church of Bermondsey St.
James.  This has been filmed by &quot;Ancestry&quot;, yet the marriage could
not be found.  The GRO reference appears correct and shows marriages of DAY,
Emma; MARSHALL, William; TYRRELL Hephzibah and WHITEHOUSE, Thomas Henry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
explanation ?  &quot;Ancestry&quot; omitted to film two facing pages of the
church register.  The bad news was that a search of the 1901 and 1911 censuses
yielded nothing useful which would resolve which bride married which groom. 
The good news was that Hephzibah is a very rare forename.  The birth of a
Hephzibah Tyrrell registered in 1867 Q1 at Newington Registration District
(RD), in the same area as the church, was encouraging.  A death search for a
Hephzibah Marshall or Whitehouse yielded only one sensible answer, Hephzibah
Whitehouse, aged 39, registered in 1906 in Aston RD.  That looked a good fit. 
Next I went to the &quot;new&quot; GRO births index in search of Whitehouse
births in 1898-1902 with Tyrrell as the mother's maiden surname.  There were
three in Southwark RD, in 1899 and 1901 (including twin boys) and one in Aston
RD in 1902.  So it's overwhelmingly probable that Thomas Henry Whitehouse
married Hephzibah Tyrrell.   Ever keen to supply details of this marriage for
my Marriage Details file on this website, I made a note to visit the London
Metropolitan Archives when they re-open.</span></p>

am delighted to report that Brian Strehlke and I have completed work on
expanding and  improving the 1881 (England &amp; Wales etc.) census file on
this website.  We started this work as long ago as 8th January 2019.   Brian
has done the lion's share and performed brilliantly, especially considering
that he is a US citizen.   My own role has been minor, mainly in checking and
interpreting problem entries, though even this has often been time-consuming. 
Hitherto, this 1881 census file was restricted to the entries found for the
Whitehouse trees of correspondents, but it is now unrestricted and as complete
and accurate as we can make it, thus bringing it into line with the other
census files.  Although many WFHC correspondent references are given, it is
likely that they are incomplete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>To
improve some items in census returns requires a good deal of investigation. 
Take, for example, the 1911 census return made by Mr. Charles Whitehouse of 77
Rupert Street, Nechells, Aston, Warwickshire.  He is aged 53, his wife, shown
as &quot;Mrs Whitehouse&quot;, is aged 51 and there are four children of ages 8
to 21.  Completed years of the present marriage were entered as &quot;4&quot;
and no children, but these years and numbers were crossed out.  Instead,
children born to the present marriage were given as 8 born alive, 6 living and
2 dead.  Wife and children were all born in Aston, Charles in nearby
Smethwick.  The problem here is that &quot;Mrs&quot; is terribly unhelpful.  A
search in the WFHC marriage files showed two possible marriages in Aston
Registration District.  For one of them, I had the details and Charles was much
too young.  For the other, I had no details and to get them one would need a
certificate, as the marriage took place in a Register Office or non-conformist
church.  Recourse to &quot;Free BMD&quot; showed the woman in this marriage was
Elsie Elizabeth Woodward or Annie Bate, but which was Charles' wife and which
married the other groom, Richard Bailey ?  Next I went to &quot;Family
Search&quot;, which showed a child baptised to Richard and Elsie Elizabeth
Bailey.  That was verified by finding a birth registration in the new GRO index,
giving the mother's maiden name as Woodward.  It followed that Charles
Whitehouse must have married Annie Bate.  So, &quot;Mrs&quot; was replaced by
&quot;Annie&quot; and a note inserted in square brackets in the WFHC 1911
transcript file.  After searching in four indexes, the probable correct
forename was arrived at !</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Having
been researching family trees on and off for 60 years, I thought I had
&quot;seen everything&quot; as regards GRO certificates, but I was wrong.  When
investigating the marriage of Jonathan Smith to Ellen Sowter at Syleham parish
church in Suffolk, I obtained a GRO certificate, which was clearly written and
showed them to have been married on 29th October 1869.   However, when I came
to check the registration in the GRO marriage index, it became clear that the
marriage could not have taken place in the 4th quarter of 1869, but could have
done so in the same quarter of 1870.  It's important to remember that these GRO
certificates were generated by the vicar or a churchwarden copying from the
original register onto loose sheets which were then sent to the GRO.  They are
mere copies from the original register and as such are subject to the
fallibility of transcription.</span></p>

a related theme, one cannot necessarily believe all that one reads on certificates. 
Elsie Cleobury Talbott was born on 3rd February 1895.  After her first husband,
Thomas Reuben Dainty Pargeter, died, she re-married on 14th September 1939 to a
soldier.  The marriage certificate names her as Elsie Cleobury Ann Pargeter
(wrong: &quot;Ann&quot; is a later addition), aged 29 (wrong: she was 44),
spinster (wrong: she was a widow), giving her father's name as Thomas Ruben
Pargeter (the misspelt name of her first husband:  her father was William Henry
Talbott, but to say so would admit that she was a widow or illegitimate).  </span></p>

into civil partnerships, will allow for mother s names to be included in
Marriage Registers as well as or in place of father s names.  It also makes

color:#333333'>In essence, the proposals will replace Marriage Registers and
Marriage Certificates (issued at the time of the wedding) with a Marriage
Document which will be prepared by the officiating priest before the wedding. 
At the ceremony, the Marriage Document will be signed by the couple, their
witnesses and the officiating priest (in much the same way as the Registers are
currently).  The significant difference is that the couple will then need to
ensure that the Marriage Document is deposited at the local Register Office
within 7 days of the date of the wedding and the local Superintendent Registrar
will then record the details and issue the couple with a Marriage Certificate.
The couple can ask someone to lodge the Marriage Document on their behalf (as
in many cases they will, of course, be on honeymoon!), but it is their
responsibility (not the officiating minister s responsibility) to ensure that
it is done.  I cannot help wondering whether Marriage Documents deposited later
than this will attract a fine or a surcharge for the certificate, as a means of
boosting the revenue of the Register Office.</span></p>

discussion. The Regulations envisage that there will be some form of secure
online portal to which clergy will need access, as there is provision for
couples to be reminded by email from the General Register Office if they have
not lodged the Document within the required period.  In the shorter term, it is
likely that clergy will be issued with a stock of Marriage Documents (similar
to the books of Marriage Certificates which are currently provided by the GRO).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Upgrading
the Whitehouse deaths index (England &amp; Wales) has been a challenging
experience and I must start by paying tribute to Brian Strehlke who has done
almost all the work on supplying ages for years 1837 to 1865, using the new,
online General Register Office for England &amp; Wales (GRO) index.  Thereby
hangs a tale.  It was known that this new index recorded all ages as if they
were years, even though some were months or weeks, maybe even days or hours,
making it impossible to rely on any age of 23 or less being accurate. 
Nevertheless, the decision was made to press on with enhancing the WFHC deaths
file by including the ages as stated, though some were submitted to the GRO for
possible correction.   After Brian had finished, the GRO revised the ages,
reducing those less than a year old to 0, and those from 12 to 23 months to 1.  While
this was necessary to avoid misleading the public any longer, it did result in
a loss of information.  Given this situation, I compared the previous ages with
the revised ones and set up a new column to record the previous ages which had
been reduced to 0 or 1 years.  The previous ages were found to be useful in
correlating some of the GRO index entries with the WFHC Black Country Burials
file, since infants' ages in burial registers were usually recorded in months
and weeks.  These and a few other correlations have been entered in the
&quot;Remarks&quot; column, but it is important to bear in mind that (a) they
are merely examples to test the usefulness of the previous ages and (b) they do
not attempt to reproduce the whole of the burial entry, which will normally
record the include the abode of the deceased and sometimes the date of death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
exercise of adding ages brought about an interesting oddity, by which the age
of a John Whitehouse of Hill Top, West Bromwich, who died in 1838, was
previously shown in the new GRO index as 32, but was reduced by the revision to
0.   On obtaining the certificate, a possible explanation emerged:  the age was
interpreted as 3 years 2 months; there is an odd-looking squiggle to the left
of and just below the level of &quot;months&quot;, being read as a
&quot;2&quot;, which is not unreasonable since the alternative, &quot;8&quot;,
was written differently in the year &quot;1838&quot;.  Thus, it is surmised, 3
years 2 months was shown as 32, the years and months being neglected.  When it
came to a revision, the squiggle was read as a false pen stroke or overlooked
and the age read as 3 months, meaning that 0 years would be entered.    [I am
no computer expert and had intended to insert a picture of the certificate
here, but, sadly, I have failed to use the correct hypertext marked language. 
If there is anyone out there who can do this for me in Notepad, an offer would
be welcome].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>After
Brian's work on the ages, I added another improvement by using the new index to
convert initials in the old GRO index to the full forename.  There were over
180 of these, a surprising number, even considering that they include deaths
registered in 1866, in the last half of 1910 and all 1911.  This threw up an
interesting change, by which a James Benjamin W Whitehouse was shown to be James
Benjamin Whitehouse Griffiths.  This was one of 10 deletions made during our
work; there were 5 additions, as shown in the file GRO D del-add which can be
accessed in BMD EXPLANATIONS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>By
the way, forenames in the  new GRO online index need to be treated with
caution, as they have not been transcribed 100 percent  perfectly.  Thus, I
have seen Foxall rendered as Forall, Phineas as Phincas and Walter as Walker.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Assiduous
readers will know that the WFHC 1881 census file for England &amp; Wales was
established to index trees of the WFHC registered correspondents, whose numbers
are shown in the extreme right hand column.  Being incomplete, it has been
referred to as a &quot;referencing file&quot;.  Brian and I have begun a
collaborative project of &quot;in-filling&quot; this file with census entries
that are not referenced.   Brian has been adding the new entries and checking
the referenced ones entered by me, following which I have checked all the
entries.  We have covered Pieces 1 to 1500, which include London and the &quot;Home
Counties&quot; surrounding it.  This is time-consuming work and how much
further we shall get remains to be seen.  I am immensely grateful to Brian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Meanwhile,
I have been busy extending the file of grant details of wills and
administrations, taken from the index of the Principal Probate Registry (PPR)
in England &amp; Wales, from 1960 to 1967.   This is not the simple task that
it might appear, as the processing to put the PPR index into spreadsheet form
is intricate and each row involves more typing than those in most other WFHC
files.  Anyhow, it has been completed, resulting in a 20 percent increase in
the number of wills and administrations.  Reader, do send me an e-mail to
whitehousefhc at waitrose dot com as it is always interesting to know if anyone
looks at this twaddle.  As before, the dates of death have been correlated with
the GRO index, making it possible to show an age at death.  The opportunity has
also been taken to revise 1951-57, a section of the index which has never been
properly checked.  This massive file in A4 landscape prints out at 267 pages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Beyond
1967 towards the present day becomes less useful, because the place of death
has been omitted from the PPR index, which means that it would be impossible
reliably and consistently to identify the correct entry in the GRO deaths index
and thereby an age at death.  That would remove an important advantage of the
WFHC file. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>More
checking needs to be done on other years in this probate file, a task which
does not require anything more than internet access, so if there are any
volunteers, I would be grateful.</span></p>

had hoped during the last 12 months to number the 274 trees and use the tree
numbers instead of correspondent references.  Thus, for example, references to

simple exercise, as it would have to be done in all the census files, in
several marriage files and three probate files.  I have not had the time to
tackle this, knowing that it would require a great deal of care and vigilance
to avoid getting into a mess !</span></p>

RAWORTH married George WALKER on 7th September 1852 at Radcliffe-on-Trent St
Mary.  Radcliffe-on-Trent is a Nottinghamshire village in Bingham Registration
District (RD).  Bizarrely, the General Register Office Index shows the RD for
this marriage as Newark, which is a long way away.  1852 was a changeover year
in which the volume numbers for RDs were changed, Nottinghamshire becoming 7b
instead of 15.  From other entries it is apparent that the GRO clerks were
confused by where in their sequence to position Bingham marriages, muddling
them with Newark ones in the sequence of RDs.</span></p>

&quot;Ancestry&quot; for any Edith born in Chorley with this exact birth date. 
Lo and behold, there was one, Edith Walsh, baptised 16 January 1899 at Chorley
St Peter, birth date 12 November 1898, according to the transcripts.  Wonderful
!   Then I looked for the transcript by the Lancashire on-line parish clerks. 
To my dismay, it gave the birth date as 11 December 1898 and I have always
regarded their work highly.  To resolve the problem, I found an online image of
the baptisms register.  There in the margin was written: &quot;born
11/12/1898&quot;, which is the customary dd/mm/yyyy way of writing dates in
this country.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Newsletter, 3rd April 2018</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Dear Readers,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>You will have
noted from the index page that the next full website update will not take place
until a year from now.  I need to get more serious about working on my own
ancestral lines other than Whitehouse.  While I shall be doing some Whitehouse
work on records and trees, it will be far less than I have been doing. 
Difficult choices have had to be made.  That said, any offer of help with
taking my Whitehouse probate index for England &amp; Wales further forward into
the 1960s would be very well received.  The principal requirement is an ability
to copy the existing style.  The official index works only on surnames, one
year at a time, is slightly tricky and often tedious to use and, unlike mine,
does not correlate the date of death given in the grant (will/administration) with
the GRO deaths index.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Records
progress</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The biggest
event this quarter is the scanning of most of my collection of copies of wills
and administrations obtained from the various diocesan registries, covering
1611 to 1857.   Many are scanned as pdfs, but some have been transcribed and
some abstracted.   These scans etc. will be sent on request to anyone who has
read the appropriate PROB PEOPLE file, quotes the WFHC reference shown in that
file or in the PROB GRANTS file and gives a plausible reason for wanting to see
the full documents.  The PROB GRANTS file, accessible via a link from PROB
EXPLANATIONS, has been revised to include a column showing what is available. 
This facility is open to any reader, whether registered as a correspondent or
not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Since a
typical scanned will of 5 pages occupies over 3MB of digital space, it might
well be sent by &quot;WE TRANSFER&quot;, &quot;Dropbox&quot;, or another cloud
type service.  There might be quite a lot of merit in requesting a transcript
if available, as most of the transcribing has been done by me and I am used to
reading secretary hand, the old script in which the older wills and
administrations were written.  I am not good at deciphering abbreviated Latin
used in the forms of grant:  while probates of wills are mainly in a standard
form, some grant recitals in Latin are very difficult to read, so I have paid a
professional translator on three occasions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have also
created a file of famous Whitehouses.  Please treat this as a first attempt and
do tell me if you think anyone else ought to be included or if you can improve
the entries.  Follow the same format as in that file, if possible, please. 
Access is via MISC EXPLANATIONS, as this is referenced to WFHC trees and is
therefore treated as a database.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The above
activities have been more time-consuming than you might suppose and I have
therefore had little time to devote to updating trees, which also requires a
big input of hours, sometimes more than a week being spent on a single tree. 
This quarter I have completed Trees 049, 053 and 087.  That choice is not
arbitrary:  049 was the last tree not to be put into Excel; 053 is that of
Brian Strehlke, whom I cannot thank enough for his work on the Black Country
Burials Index and the GRO Deaths index, the revision and improvement of which
latter is in progress; and 087 is responsive to a correspondent who wrote me a
very nice letter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Data
Protection</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have been
wondering what action to take in the light of the new General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.  This is due to come into force on
25th May 2018.  Unlike Directives, EU Regulations are directly applicable law
in the UK.  There is also a UK Bill going through Parliament at present.  If
there were a business relationship with my correspondents, for example if they
were required to pay a membership fee, I suppose that I would have to contact
them all, asking them to e-mail me giving me permission to hold their data on
computer etc.  In effect, they would have to re-register.  However, I charge no
fees and regard all my registered correspondents as personal friends.  So, at
least for the present, my view is that the GDPR does not apply to my
situation.  Anyhow, I have decided to change my policy about disclosure of
addresses, both e-mail and postal and not to disclose anyone's details to
anyone else, even if they are distant cousins sharing the same tree.  Telephone
numbers have always been confidential to me and will remain so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Tree
numbers</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I plan to
change my referencing system in the next few months.  At present, Whitehouse
trees to which more than one correspondent is attached are referenced in my
databases according to a complicated system which, basically allots a
correspondent number to events in the part of a tree that lie closest to that
correspondent's descent, or, if there is no one correspondent closer than
another, to all of them.  In future, all events on a tree will be referenced by
the lowest correspondent number.  So, for example, Tree 012, which is shared by
ten other people (057 185 193 238 410 499 509 533 549 550) will just be
referenced 012 in the databases and not, let us say, only 549 550.  This is a
complex operation, given the large number of databases that are referenced. 
Using simple tools, they will need to be stationed head to foot in a single
file occupying so many rows that they will have first to be converted into
Excel 2013 files.  My daughter could write me a code in &quot;Visual
Basic&quot; to do the job more elegantly, but it would probably take longer
overall and her time is more valuable than mine (sadly!).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>News from
&quot;Family Search&quot;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In January, I
attended a talk given by Sharon Hintze, the recently retired director of the
London Family History Centre.  The talk was mainly about her own family and the
businesses in Birmingham which they owned or in which they worked.  She gave
the following figures for the expanding population of Birmingham:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1801:

1,074,000</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Apart from
this, I found little in it to interest me.  However, she also told us some
useful things about the London Family History Centre, which remains located
within The National Archives building at Kew and seems likely to remain there
for many years.  The Latter Day Saints (LDS) still want to build a new centre
and meeting house at Oliver House, 51-53 City Road, London, but this is within
a Conservation Area and the LDS is only at the stage of pre-planning advice. 
The LDS's decision to get rid of their microfilms, which are now housed at The Society
of Genealogists (SoG) in London, has proved deeply unpopular, since access to
them was free at the Family History Centre and now requires either membership
of the SoG or payment of a search fee.  The plan is for everything on film to
go digital, but that project has a long way to go and, personally, I don't find
it very quick to scroll through images when trawling a long period of years or
when there is no direct link to the page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Holdings of
material at the LDS's Family History Centres can be accessed on line via the
&quot;Family Search&quot; Catalog and selecting Society of Genealogists (or
other centre) from the menu.  The change is convenient for me as I am a member
of the SoG, intend to remain so and can get there much more easily than to The
National Archives at Kew.  Using &quot;Family Search&quot; now involves
registration (free) and many images can only be accessed at a Family History
Centre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Among the
films at the SoG are those for the  English &amp; Welsh probate registries,
which enable one to read a will for which there is a grant of probate or
administration from 1858 to 1925.  Here's how:  in the &quot;Family
Search&quot; Catalog enter in Keywords &quot;record copy wills&quot; and it
will come up with links to the Principal Probate Registry and District Registry
film collections.  Of course, you have to know where the will was proved, but
you can get this from the online Principal Probate Registry calendar of wills
or, if it's a Whitehouse, from the WFHC database.  Then you have to identify
the correct film number.  This is quite a tricky business in which it is easy
to make a mistake, but, with care, it can be done.  The whole process amounts
to rather advanced searching, but saves paying a fee to get the will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
uncontactables</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In the
January newsletter, I mentioned not being able to tell correspondent 107 that I
had a new tree (081) to send her, since neither her e-mail address nor her
telephone number worked.  In former days, I would send a letter to such a
person, but that didn't work very often, so I just wasted postages.  At one
time, for several years, I put a list of uncontactables on the WFHC website,
but never got any response by doing so.  I made two attempts, on well separated
days, to 'phone correspondent 285, who is connected to the same tree, but the
initial ringing tone twice reverted to an &quot;engaged&quot; signal, so I
shall not waste any more time.  My message to her is that you have a five
letter surname in which all three consonants are the same, so if ever you read
this, you will know who you are!   Generally stated, however, my policy now is
that it is up to correspondents to get in touch with me, especially if they 
have improvements to make their tree, as these will be very welcome and if
their tree is not on the website, it will be put in the queue for updating in
all respects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A cameo of
genealogical difficulties</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Correspondent
087, who is not on e-mail, wrote me a lovely thank you letter.  As she gave her
'phone number, we had a chat.  I reckoned that she deserved to have her tree
taken out of turn to be updated.  It was 8 pages before I started and full of
problems, even though these Whitehouses lived in or near the town of Warwick,
which is out of their usual Black Country area.   I had just got to the last
page and the marriage of Henry Whitehouse to a Jane of unknown surname. 
According to the 1901 census, they had children Jane born 1897-98 at Kennington
in Oxfordshire and Henry born about September 1900 in Oxford.  That made sense
as Henry's father had died in 1898 in Headington Registration District.  Headington
is a suburb of Oxford City nowadays.  However, I could find no marriage of this
couple and no birth registration for Jane.  I did find one for Henry in 1900,
but it was in Warwick.  The new, online, GRO index showed that the mothers'
maiden surname was Hiles.  Armed with that information, I found the birth
registrations of five others, including Mary registered in the first quarter of
1898 in Warwick Registration District, but still no Jane.  I concluded that
Mary and Jane must be one and the same daughter, which was confirmed by the
1911 census, showing no Mary, but including Jane aged 13, born in Oxford,
Oxfordshire and all the other siblings that I had found by entering the
mother's maiden surname of Hiles.  So Henry and Jane must have been merely partners,
passing themselves off as married, as so many did.   Just to check this out
better, I started reading further down the chronological list of marriages of
Henry Whitehouses in my own GRO Marriage Index, when I came upon the marriage
of Henry Whitehouse to Jane Hiles in 1905, eight years after the birth of their
first child, at the improbable venue of Hereford Register Office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have been
blitzing the piles of stuff that I keep from &quot;Family Tree&quot; magazine,
as they were just too interesting to throw away.  I loved the article &quot;The
tick tock of the biological clock&quot; by Ruth A. Symes in the July 2015
issue.  To give you the flavour, it is written as 10 questions and answers,
starting with &quot;When did puberty start ?&quot;, to which the author's reply
was &quot;It is believed that most Victorian girls started to menstruate at
around age 15....&quot;.   The author has very kindly given me permission to
reproduce her original article, before it was embellished by &quot;Family

a death certificate in which the cause of an infant death is given as
dentition&quot;, that is to say teething ?  It has always seemed to me most
improbable.  An article by Sally George in the April 2018 &quot;Family

preparations such as &quot;Godfrey's Cordial&quot; and &quot;Collis Browne's

cocktail based on opium, cannabis and chloroform.  They would have died of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Happy New
Year!  2018, wow, only 4 more years to go until the 1921 census becomes
available.  A more sober reflection is that I have no hope of doing anything

doctors, nurses and midwives and is labelled &quot;MEDICS&quot;.  There are 54

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Much of my
work these last 2 months has been devoted to improving the 1601-1730 part of
the Lichfield Consistory Court wills.  In the course of this, three wrong
entries in the Lichfield Record Office's grants calendar were discovered:  LFCX-01,
-02 and -10, which have been removed, because the deceased is not a
Whitehouse.  Wills and administrations of which I did not have copies have now
been abstracted, so that indexing of this early period is now complete for this
Court.  I plan to transcribe a couple of the documents, one a will and the
other an administration; the Latin of the latter having defeated me, I am
having it professionally translated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>While on the
subject of Lichfield wills, I am still waiting for Findmypast to index the many
wills and administrations of the Peculiar Courts.  I need this to check that I
have not missed any when trawling the calendars on film, after which I intend
to renumber.  Myko Clelland, Findmypast's &quot;ambassador&quot;, has mentioned
that FMP will aim to make a &quot;spring splash&quot; of new records, so I am
hoping that they will appear then.  So far, all that I know is that they are
not undergoing transcription, which, Myko says, indicates that either it has
not started or is already complete and being checked.  I am not optimistic and
there might come a point when I simply have to take a chance and hope that I
have not missed one.  One problem is divergence between the calendar of all
Lichfield Peculiar grants and the individual calendars of these Courts.  Thus,
I found that the calendar for the Royal Peculiar Court of Bridgnorth, in
Shropshire contained two items not in the all-Peculiars one, a most puzzling
occurrence.  They were for a Rachaell Whitehouse in 1737 and a Jeremiah
Whitehouse in 1743.  A kind member of the Lichfield Record Office staff found
that there were no grant documents available.  I searched the parish registers
for the two Bridgnorth parishes, hoping to find a burial, without success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Since my last
website update on 1st November, I have completed a task of great drudgery which
brought no reward in terms of new results.  On the shelves of the Society of
Genealogists in London are books of more than 100 Shropshire parish registers,
nearly all of which are the Shropshire Parish Register Society's transcripts
made than 70 years ago.  Their coverage of marriages was usually limited to
pre-1812, but occasionally extended to pre-1838.  I completed reading the
indexes to see whether I could extend my West Midlands &amp; Shropshire pre-GRO
marriage index, but found nothing new.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I mentioned
two months ago, the surprise arrival on 27th October of some database material
from someone who is not a registered correspondent.  Sadly, I simply do not
have the time to do everything that I would like and I have yet to tackle
this.  There are three other things that I would like to do to improve the
records for archiving.  One is to extend the probate index from 1961 to 1970,
because year by year searching in the official online index is laborious.  The
other two are to improve my Scottish census records and to extract Scottish
wills of Whitehouses.  Alas, these will remain pipe dreams unless I get offers
of help.  The Scottish records will have to be paid for, but I am happy to
finance that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Turning now
to the WFHC collection of Whitehouse trees, I had two trees which existed only
as pdf files of the correspondent's own tree, namely 049 and 081.  The latter
has been thoroughly revised, hugely expanded and put into my standard Excel
format.  It took a long time, but in the course of this work, I linked in
correspondent 230's tree, so Tree 081 now connects to 107, 230 and 285. 
However, 081 is believed deceased, contact with him having been lost in 2000,
107 is neither e-mailable or telephonable, while 285 has not updated her e-mail
address and if she cannot be bothered or is too disorganised to do that, why
should I trouble to telephone her in a greatly different time zone ?  Maybe I
shall relent in due course, but I hope that other readers of this newsletter
will take note.  I do not mind simply checking that I have an e-mail entered
correctly in my private register, so if you have not been in contact for some
years and think that I might not have your latest address, do please ask. 
Meanwhile, Tree 049 is receiving the same treatment, but I am only half way
through that work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The next
items on my agenda are to improve and upload trees 041 to 050.  I have already
done much of the research required and my in-tray is full of the printouts,
heavily scrawled on.  After or during that process, tree 053 deserves my
attention, because linked correspondent 563 has worked on it.  So, I have my

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I
have analysed the WFHC coverage of Whitehouse marriages (England &amp; Wales)
in the period 1837Q3 to 1911.  The number of such marriages with assigned
husbands and wives has reached 8386, which is 94.5% of the 8876 listed.  To
remind readers, an &quot;f&quot; in the column headed &quot;Det&quot; means
that substantially full details are provided in the Marriage Details file under
the same Universal Number (UN).  Full details mean what you get in a
certificate except for the name of the officiating clergyman or registrar and
whether or not the parties have signed their name.  There are now 7279 with
full details, which is 82%.  Additionally, there are 26 with partial details
and 7 with a small amount of detail.</span></p>

long-running project to scan my collection of wills proved and administrations
granted (England &amp; Wales) in church courts is still pending.  This is
because the Lichfield Consistory Court ones have been filmed and digital images
put on &quot;Findmypast&quot;, which has caused me to make some alterations and
re-number, but most particularly because they are supposed to be doing the same
for the Peculiar Courts and I so am waiting for this, in case further amendment
is required.  I doubt whether it is worth scanning in my collection of
Lichfield wills when they are or will become available on line and when I do
not have copies of all of them anyway.  However, I shall proceed with scanning
for the other courts</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I
have devoted a large part of October to updating trees from 030 to 040.  This
has been no simple task, for many of them are very large and my progress has
thus been slow.  The biggest job has been Tree 036, which has 12 correspondents
attached to it, runs to 25 pages and contains 70 notes.  All the files up to
040 have been deglitched (I hope) and put into an improved standard format, a

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
new GRO index</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I
have reported for investigation by the GRO some of the deaths shown in the new
index with an age at death ranging from 1 to 22, as it is unclear whether this
really means years or could be months, weeks, or even hours.  This is a serious
worry for my Whitehouse deaths database, because there are so many that fall
within this category.  As it stands at present, the database is in effect in
two parts, one covering 1st July 1837 to 1865, with no ages at death given and
the other 1866 to 1911.   If I entered some of the more reliable ages at death
in the earlier section, endless confusion would ensue, as one would not know
whether the others were accurate or not, nor could reliability be guaranteed. 
There would also be a sorting problem.  So I have concluded that the best
solution is to enter the ages for 1st July 1837 to 1865, taken from the new
index, in a separate column.   That provides the opportunity to compare the
WFHC index, which was compiled from the paper registers at St. Catherine's
House, London many years ago, with the new GRO index.  While m</span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>ost of the work
consists simply in adding the age at death, early signs are that the new index
contains some entries not in the present WFHC index, which need investigation. 
Differences in names between old and new indexes are likely to occur because
the new indexing started from afresh, i.e. from the original copy registers
which are used to make up the certificates that the GRO issues.</span></p>

have made a start, but need some help here, please.  This is an ideal project
for home working.  All that is needed is Microsoft Excel, which is part of the
Office suite, access to the internet and, preferably, a printer too. 
Instructions and the file in which to insert ages at death and remarks will be
supplied.   This would be particularly well suited to a careful worker, to whom
I would allot, say, 5 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>It
is now possible to view the GRO's responses to one's own reports.  Where a
correction is being made, it is to express the age in years.  The effect of
this is in some cases to diminish useful information; for example, if someone
is born in the second quarter of the year, their suspected death is in the
first quarter of the following year, at the age of &quot;9&quot;, it would have
to be 9 months (if the suspected death is correct), but it would be corrected
by the GRO to &quot;0&quot;.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Inheriting
a surname: a game of chance ?</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>How
likely is it that an English surname existing after the Black Death would have
survived to the 1851 census ?  This was the question that Dr. John Plant and
Prof. Richard Plant set out to answer in their article in Journal of One-Name
Studies, October to December 2017 at pages 13 to 15.  They used a technique
called Monte Carlo simulation, which was expounded in 1983 and states that a
part of the population, here people having a given surname, will behave
statistically the same way as the whole population.  They generated random
numbers on a computer, each having digits of either zero or one, corresponding
to a toss of a coin for a head or a tail.  For example, a sequence 0, 1, 1, 0,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1  is equivalent to four heads and six tails.  They did this a
million times, which on average gave 5.0008 ones (heads) in every 10.  Pausing
here, it seems to me that a million tosses was not enough !  The question then
becomes one of how many runs of ten straight heads (the same surname) occur in
the million simulated tosses and the answer is 978, which, the authors say, is
close to a theoretical figure of 977.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Having
thus established in a simple way the validity of their computerised method,
they apply this to the population figures for England, using 2.7 million as the
base figure in 1371 and 15,288,885  in the 1851 census, and reckoning the
number of generations between these dates, at 30 year intervals, as 16.   It
turned out that the male line survived in 22.6 percent of the million
simulations.  The question then devolves into how many people of a given
surname are likely to have survived to 1851.  The median figure is 18, but the
authors prefer to consider how many survivors there are in the first 95 percent
of the total, which yields a range of 1 to 71.  In rare cases, it could be more
than 71 and the authors found that their largest figure was 290.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Of
course, this is a very rough method which makes many assumptions, not least
that those having a particular surname form a large enough part of the
population to make the Monte Carlo principle valid.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Moreover,
in 1851, as today, there were more females than males:  </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>there were in Great
Britain 10,386,048 males and 10,735,919 females, so the gender imbalance was
observable then.  Even soldiers stationed abroad and not in the census would
not account for such a large difference.  There are some possible genetic
reasons for this.  According to my wife, who has a better knowledge of genetics
than I do, </span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>there is a
greater chance of a mutation in the X chromosome, which is much longer than the
Y, leading to destruction of the embryo or higher infant mortality in the XY
males.  </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In
XX females, the second X chromosome might not carry the defective gene and if
the mutated gene is recessive, the second X chromosome might be sufficient to
provide a healthy female.  However, the situation has other complicating
factors, with sperm carrying the Y chromosome, which is lighter, moving faster
in conception, and with males being more likely to die through inherent
aggression characteristics, e.g. they fought wars and died before marrying and
conceiving.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Then
there is a doubt that the number of generations can properly be assumed to be
calculable as the total years divided by 30.  A calculation from my own tree in
the male line (not Whitehouse), working from a single male progenitor, within a
233 year period and extending over 9 generations gave it as 233/9 = 26.  The
general problem is that over a much longer period than 233 years, generation
intervals are skewed, with early mortality of males occurring at the ancient
end and generations being incomplete at the modern end.  In my own tree, only 6
of the 9 generations were complete, meaning that there could be no more
children from it (under normal circumstances).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>So,
while the research was interesting to read and think about, I question its
practical applicability.</span></p>

 80 for full membership and  56 for associate, online membership.  Associates

big shock to current members, who have been paying  54 for full membership, but
the plan is to increase the fee for existing members gradually.  Strangely,
perhaps, I welcome this news, because the Society has to pay its way far better
than it has been doing and the increase injects some realism into the financial
situation in which the Society is only just breaking even.  Perhaps it is worth
reminding readers that the films of parish records etc. that used to be at the
Family History Centre, located in The National Archives building at Kew, have

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A
John Whitehouse of Owens River in New South Wales died in 1846, intestate, or
so it was said by his neighbour, Joseph Nathan, who was a blacksmith.  Nathan
wanted to be paid for rounding up and selling some of the deceased's cattle, about
30 of which had been running on his land.  John was presumably a convict who
had been transported, as the court papers show that he had a wife (unnamed) and
family in Staffordshire.  These papers show some confusing goings-on, in which
another neighbour, William Clark, made an affidavit attaching a &quot;paper
writing&quot; dated on the day of John Whitehouse's death said to be his will. 
The will was allegedly read to John Whitehouse and his mark made in the
presence of William Clark and none other than Joseph Nathan !   A fake will,
not executed properly and probably not even written down ?  Probably, but it
illustrates the point that as in England the court would make every effort to
validate the wish of the deceased.  Incidentally, there was no death registered
for this John Whitehouse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In
the last half year I have made two major advances with my Whitehouse records. 
The first is to create a &quot;Black Country&quot; burials index for 1813 to
1861 which covers a very large area of South Staffordshire and North
Worcestershire.  This has involved a lot of work, especially as some church
records have had to be trawled, there being no printed or online index.  It
involved a spectacular trip to the West Midlands in which I visited four
archives in a day.  The project has been driven by the unreliability of the new
GRO index of deaths, as mentioned below.</span></p>

second advance is not yet visible on the website.  It is to scan my entire
Whitehouse wills and administrations collection in diocesan archives around the
country.  This is no easy task as the individual pages of a will have often
been copied onto different sizes of paper.  It has been a necessary preliminary
step to copy all the pages of many of the documents to A3 or A4 paper and try
to reduce the number of pages as far as possible.  This step is nearly
complete, but a few wills will have to be transcribed for various reasons and
this is time-consuming.  Another difficulty will be creating a new website in

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A
change of objective</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I
wrote in January that I intended to update my births and deaths indexes using
the new General Register Office one, primarily to extend coverage of the
mother's maiden surname at birth and ages at death.  I have changed my mind,
having discovered how unreliable are the new indexes.  Any ages at death under
24 cannot be relied on, as the new index does not say whether the figure given
refers to years, months or days.  This error appears to be a piece of wonderful
stupidity that applies throughout.  It has spurred me to improve my index of
Whitehouse burials in the West Midlands (see above).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>As
to the mother's maiden surname, this is usually right, but &quot;usually&quot;
is not good enough;  the problem is that one can make a search using the
married surname and the maiden surname and fail to find a birth.  I finally
reached the nadir of exasperation on discovering that &quot;Snape&quot; had
been transcribed as &quot;Sncap&quot;.  At least this was an obvious error, but
&quot;Butter&quot; for &quot;Butler&quot; is not.  One of the things that I do
when confronted by an unusual name is to put it into &quot;FreeBMD&quot; with
no date restriction to see what it produces.  If then I cannot find a single
instance of the name or maybe only one or two, I begin to think that it must be
wrong.</span></p>

things have been happening here.  Many readers will know that the LFHC is
housed in The National Archives building at Kew in West London and this
arrangement will continue until at least March 2019.  However, the Latter Day
Saints have handed over their entire stock of 60,000 microfilms to the Society
of Genealogists.  It's a resource that has been massively underused.  The LDS
is in the midst of a project to digitise all its microfilm records and, of
course, many are available on subscription websites.  The difficulty is that
the project has not been completed and it will still be necessary to consult
the microfilms for some while.  Indeed, some who wish to trawl a parish
register will find a microfilm quicker and easier.  Curiously, it will remain
possible until 31st August next to order a film from Salt Lake City and it will
thereafter be available to read at the LFHC.  Apart from that, however, the
LFHC will be merely somewhere to go to use computers for free access to the
LDS' digitised records and subscription websites.  Meanwhile, the Society of
Genealogists is now far better equipped with film readers, also donated by the
LFHC.  As a member of the SoG that suits me just fine, but others will have to
pay the SoG's search fees.  The SoG has been losing money, but in the last
financial year managed to make a small profit, largely by closing on Fridays
and cutting staff.</span></p>

Society of Genealogists' quarterly journal has become more interesting lately
and I was much impressed by a paper on this subject.  The amount of controversy
is truly amazing to us today.  One early feature was that very few civil
marriages were taking place.  In the first complete year, out of 111,481 marriages
registered in England and Wales, 2,976 took place in non-Anglican places of
worship and 1,093 in registrars' offices.</span></p>

an advertising feature in the January 2017 &quot;Family Tree&quot; magazine,
the Jersey Archive has recently finished a digitisation project for all the
wills and testaments of moveable property between 1770 and 1949.  I learned
that up to the 19th century these documents nearly always record the father of
the testator and the &quot;parish of origin&quot;, though whether this means the
origin of the testator or his father was not made clear.  Also, women who are
married or widowed are generally recorded by their maiden name.  A search under
the Whitehouse surname (which is free) brought forth the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1.  Will and
testament of Mary Lavinia WHITEHOUSE widow of Thomas BOWEN of West Winds,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Investigation
of the first entry showed that Mary Lavinia WHITEHOUSE married Thomas BOWEN on
10th April 1900 at Bobbington Holy Cross church in Staffordshire.  The marriage
is referenced to Whitehouse correspondents 262 and 294.  Re item 2, &quot;Family
Search&quot; says that Harold William WHITEHOUSE was born on 1st June 1914 and
died in 1974 at Worthing.  Letters of Administration were granted in England,
giving a date of death of 10th September 1974.  Harold had a brother, Walter C
WHITEHOUSE, born in 1917.  In both instances, their mother's maiden name was
AYLING.  Unfortunately, a search of WHITEHOUSE-AYLING marriages England &amp;
Wales was negative. so perhaps the mother had married previously, they married
elsewhere or the couple were unmarried.  How a 1974 probate qualifies for
inclusion in a database in which the most modern year is supposed to be 1949 is
unclear: perhaps the project has been extended.</span><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Dear Readers,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>It's a
game-changer</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The new GRO
births and deaths indexes have caused me to undertake a massive re-think of my
priorities.  If you are unfamiliar with them, please refer to the article that
I have prepared and which is linked to the index page of this website.  As a
result, I have come to the following decisions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1.   Much
more can now be done to update trees, but to do so is even more time-consuming
than before.  I shall abandon this process, except for those trees on which
work is in progress or which have been sent to me by the relevant correspondent
or my kind helpers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>2.   I shall
archive my stock of other trees in their existing state of research.  If I
receive any updated versions from correspondents, I will review them and, after
any necessary amendment, archive those instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>3.   In the
archiving project, I shall have to put all the trees into a uniform format and,
as there are 276 trees, this will take quite a long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>4.   This
website is hosted by John Lewis Broadband, but their free digital space
allowance of 100 MB will soon become too small and, as they will not increase
it, I shall have to buy website hosting or resort to cloud storage, in order to
place the all the archived trees on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>5.   I shall
start improving the WFHC births and deaths indexes, using the new GRO indexes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>6.   I shall
not answer any enquiries from the general public, only from existing registered
correspondents and members of the Guild of One-Name Studies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>These
decisions mean, sadly, that some of my census files, particularly those for
1881 and 1911 will not be as fully referenced with correspondent numbers as I
had hoped.  Also, more of my errors will go undetected.  However, it is better
to leave a legacy of something less than perfect than nothing at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Progress</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In the last
half year, I have been working on my own trees and so have not devoted much
time to Whitehouses.  That stated, I have been searching the records of the
Royal Mail Archives, taking the opportunity to do so before they closed in
November for about 6 months.  The modest results of my labours can be accessed
via MISC EXPLANATIONS.  I have also spent many hours updating trees 026, 030,
031 (not quite finished yet) and 034, using the new GRO indexes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have been
assisted in updating other trees by Brian Strehlke, Adrian Loker, Roberta
Ashworth and Robert Whitehouse, whom I thank wholeheartedly and assure that
their work will be used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Updating
your tree</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In the last 5
years or so, enhancements in my own website and the publicly available
databases have made most trees capable of improvement.  A lot more can be done
by using the free website <a href="http://www.freebmd.org.uk"><span
style='color:windowtext'>www.freebmd.org.uk</span></a>, particularly to find
deaths in England &amp; Wales.  When a likely death has been found, the
government s free website <a href="https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills"><span
style='color:windowtext'>https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills</span></a>
can be used to find a will (plus of course my own index on the website for
Whitehouses up to 1960).   Wills and administrations give a date and place of
death.  The Latter Day Saints' website <a href="https://familysearch.org/search"><span
style='color:windowtext'>https://familysearch.org/search</span></a> is also
very helpful, especially for deaths and census returns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Still further
and very importantly, the 1939 Register can be searched on the Findmypast
website at <a href="http://www.findmypast.co.uk/1939register"><span
style='color:windowtext'>http://www.findmypast.co.uk/1939register</span></a>. 
While the last-mentioned gives only limited information free, the full
information, which you will need, can be found in a public library which has a
subscription to Findmypast.   Alternatively, you can sign up for a 14-day free
trial and thus access it from home.   Before doing so, print out my paper on
the subject of the 1939 Register, which you will find on my website, and digest
its contents.  When revising the tree, you can either attempt to use Excel or
just make a list of all the items and I will insert them.  The 1939 Register is
not available on Ancestry or any other genealogical services provider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The new GRO
births and deaths indexes make it possible to do a very thorough job.  You can
read more about it in an article linked to the index (home) page of this website.

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Some
correspondents only half understand my 1902 limitation, despite my trying to
make it clear. The 1902 limitation is that if the <u>first-born</u> child of a
set of siblings, that is to say brothers and sisters, is born before 1902, all
these siblings are to be included in my tree.   For example, if the six
children of the marriage of John Whitehouse to Mary Smith were born between
1893 and 1907, all those 6 children are to appear on the tree, along with their
birth, death and marriage.&nbsp; In this example, the 1902 limitation does not
apply because the first child of the set of siblings was born before 1902.   If
the child born in 1907 lives to be 100, his death in 2007 qualifies to be
recorded on the tree, along with any marriage.&nbsp; If that child born in 1907
marries or has a partner and they have a child or children, those children will
not appear on the tree by name: the tree will either say  Issue  or have an
arrow to the correspondent s reference number.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A bad
morning at the office</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>For my Butler
family tree, I wanted the details of a marriage in 1904 at Blackheath St Paul
in the West Midlands.  That should be straightforward, as the film was at the
London Family History Centre which is located in The National Archives building
at Kew.  When I came to look up the entry, which I knew was No. 103 in the
Register (thanks to the West Midlands BMD website), I found that the Latter Day
Saints had omitted to film the page containing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>While I was
there, I tried to locate the marriage of Jane Whitehouse to Frederick Baker, to
add to my Marriage Details file.  It was registered in the tiny registration
district of Hambledon and I worked out that it might well have taken place in
the village of Chiddingfold, Surrey.  That would be a very romantic spot, where
the Crown Inn, steeped in history, overlooks the village green.  Well, the film
was available and I looked up the marriage, only to find that the bride was
unmistakeably a Whitehorne.</span></p>

little to report this quarter.  This is mainly because I have been busy with my
own genealogy.   My Whitehouse family history (tree 251 365) has been improved

maternal trees which include Butler and Cutts, in Nottinghamshire and
Derbyshire.  I expect to be occupied with personal trees for at least the next
two and a half years.  I am sure that you will understand that after having
devoted over 30 years to helping people with their Whitehouse genealogies, I
have to turn most of my attention to my own lines.  The great mistake that some
make is to put off writing up their family history until they have completed
their research.  The trouble is that such a time never comes - there is always
more that can be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Nevertheless,
I have carried out a small amount of Whitehouse work, some of it largely
&quot;invisible&quot; when mistakes are corrected, referencing of the databases
to WFHC correspondent numbers is improved and a few more marriage details are
added.  I have been assisted once again by Brian Strehlke who has made vast
improvements to Tree 032 and to whom I am deeply grateful.  I lost contact with
correspondent 032 over 15 years ago.  As soon as I can find time, I shall put

happen, either through clerical error or an undetected typing error.  Typed
registers were prepared from manuscript and the manuscript ones thrown away.  A

Llewellyn Thomas Ivor Prosser (GRO index page 932) married Lily Boardman (GRO

have consecutive GRO page numbers, so either 921 and 922 or 931 and 932 are

beautiful Saturday morning and I must get out into the garden.  Just lately, it
has been too wet to do anything useful, but this afternoon looks promising. 
Anyhow, I shall start the website update and hope to finish it later in the
day. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Help
wanted</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This is an
appeal for help of a different kind than in the past.  I have got to the stage
where updating and improving my existing stock of trees is far more important
than creating new databases and want help with this.  Working on such trees is
far more intellectually interesting than extracting, say, census records.  Even
apparently mundane trees have their points of interest, as I reflected while
working on Tree 035 456.  There's the family of 9 daughters, 8 of whom survived
to adulthood and married; there were no sons that could be found.  Two of these
surviving daughters were Eliza and Elizabeth, an occurrence which has been
noticed occasionally in other Whitehouse trees.  Elizabeth reduced her age by 3
years, from 23 to 20 when marrying, apparently so as not to appear older than
her 20-year old husband.  Then there was the sad case of Emma Love, a widow,
who married William Whitehouse, a blacksmith and a widower.  William died soon
afterwards aged only about 40, rapidly followed by Emma marrying for a third
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Volunteers
need access to at least &quot;Ancestry&quot; and preferably also
&quot;Findmypast&quot; for the 1939 Register.  These databases are often
available in public libraries.  Just working on one tree would be a very useful
contribution and there would be no time pressure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Donations</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>As a result
of a generous donation, I plan to have all my collection of photocopies of
pre-1858 English &amp; Welsh provincial wills and administrations (more than
250) scanned.  This is not a simple task, as many are on A3 size paper and some
partly on A3 and partly on A4:  they will all have to be examined and the pages
referenced to avoid muddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This leads me
on to say that donations of money are never solicited by me, but, if offered,
are very kindly received and never refused.  It remains a point of pride that
my records are available to download free of charge and I make no charge for
any of the work that I do in helping people with their Whitehouse trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Quarterly
report</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>My own
massive Whitehouse tree, 251 365, runs to 30 pages of chart and 25 of notes. 
It has rumbled on this quarter, as I have made more improvements to the
Nottingham lace-making branch.  It is still likely to undergo a few
modifications of detail in the coming weeks, before I put it on the website.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Another, less
massive, but still substantial, tree is 028 etc. which has its roots in the
prosperous farmers of Bickenhill, Warwickshire, a village to the south of
Birmingham.  I worked for many days on improving this and am putting it on the
website.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Two other
Whitehouse matters have occupied my time.  One has been getting to grips with
the 1939 Register, which has resulted in my producing an article for the
website.  It can be accessed from the index (home) page.  The other was adding
18 marriages from Kent and Lancashire to my marriage details file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have taken
on one new correspondent, ref. 574.  His tree brought a couple of surprises,
when I investigated it, following some helpful groundwork done by WFHC
correspondent Brian Strehlke.  The first was that by using my will indexes, I
managed to take the tree back two more generations, to a marriage in 1766.  The
other was that when investigating the modern end, I found a collateral line to
Sir Harold Beckwith Whitehouse (1882 to 1943), who has a string of initials
after his name and was a famous professor of obstetrics and gynaecology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Having just
about got to the end of my Whitehouse tree, which is in my grandfather's
mother's line, I have turned to two all-maternal lines on which I have been
collaborating with a cousin over many years.  They are for Butler and Cutts in
Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.  Having worked on them for 7 weeks, I am just
about half way, I reckon.  This work will continue through the summer months,
so progress with Whitehouse trees will be limited.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A new
series of trees ?</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have created
the first of what might turn out to be a new series of Whitehouse trees,
beginning with number 901.  This development came about through a marriage in
my own tree:  Selina Walker, a Whitehouse descendant in this tree, married an
apparently unrelated Thomas Whitehouse.  After some difficulties, I traced him
back to his roots in Birmingham, in particular to the marriage of James
Whitehouse to Ann Kinchen on 30th September 1828 at Birmingham St Martin, just
to check whether he belonged in someone else's tree in my collection.  Having
found that he did not,  I wanted to preserve the fruits of my labour in case
they might be useful one day.  However, there was no correspondent to whom the
tree could be attached.   Thomas and Selina had no children, but there might
have been cousins from a collateral line.  So, I created the tree anyway and
referenced it &quot;901&quot; in my databases.  I shall apply similar treatment
to any other potentially useful trees that I create as by-products.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Mining the
language of mining</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have often
wondered why in censuses some coal miners are described as colliers and others
not.  The matter came to a head while I was looking at the details of the
marriage of John Chambers to Ann Butler at Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, parish
church in 1852.  John was described as a collier, his father as a miner, but
Ann's father was a collier.  According to the glossary in &quot;My Ancestor was
a coal miner&quot; by David Tonks, pub. Society of Genealogists Enterprises
Limited, 2nd ed. 2010, a collier was &quot;the skilled man who worked at the
coal face and actually got the coal&quot;.  The subsidiary question then arises
as to the difference between a &quot;coal miner (hewer)&quot; and a collier: as
far as I can see, there is none, since to hew means to hack away at the face of
the coal.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I did wonder
whether a collier might be synonymous with a butty.  The same glossary calls a
butty a sub-contractor, but, pertinently for much Whitehouse genealogy, also
defines a charter master as the Staffordshire name for a big butty, who was a
superior workman who leased a pit, was paid by the ton, provided capital, paid
the men and effectively managed the works. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Sadly, even
the extensive glossary did not define &quot;dataller&quot;, but an online
source, &quot;Dictionary of Old Occupations&quot; by Jane &amp; Paul Jack Hewitt,
pub. as an e-book, 2011, defines it thus &quot; </span><span style='font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>Alternate spelling of
Daytaleman, a casual worker employed on a day rate with no job security. For
example, a man employed at a coal mine on this basis to construct and maintain
mining roadways.&quot;  As to &quot;collier&quot;, the same source says &quot;a
broad term encompassing many jobs working in coal mines or in transporting
coal&quot;, which is rather different !</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>By the way,
in case any reader is thinking of buying this book by David Tonks, the
&quot;meat&quot; of it is a mere 84 pages, plus the 14 page glossary of terms,
the remainder of its numbered 187 pages being devoted to bibliography and an
index.  Included in the bibliography is a list of holdings of record offices,
from which I note that the Staffordshire Record Office holds records of the
North Staffordshire, South Staffordshire and Cannock coalfields and that
Staffordshire University holds &quot;journals, maps, surveys, books and NCB
records&quot; in its Thompson Library in Stoke-on-Trent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Dear Readers,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I hope that
you all keep well and have happy hunting on the genealogical trail in 2016. 
It's six months since I updated this website.  Over the next few days, I shall
be updating it again.  Another update has been scheduled for early April.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Progress
report</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>You will not
see a great deal of change in the website, as I have devoted most of my
available time to my own Whitehouse tree, which is 251 365.  This is currently
being reviewed for errors by WFHC correspondent Brian Strehlke, who was kind
enough to do a good deal of work on the United States branches.  It has also
yet to be reviewed by my 5th cousin, who has the custody of her father's diary
type memoirs, entitled &quot;Warps 'n All&quot;.  He was one of the last of the
Nottingham lace makers, an industry that began there in about 1760 and
continued into the mid-20th century.  Fortunately, there is an excellent book
on Nottingham lace, written by Sheila Mason, first published in 1994 and still
available as the revised 2010 edition from the Cluny Lace Co. Ltd, Belper
Street, Ilkeston, Derbyshire DE7 5FJ (hardback, 381 pages,  25 plus p &amp; p).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Also in this 
half year, I took pity on a couple of hopeful enquirers and registered them
under refs. 572 and 573.  The latter's tree fitted nicely into an existing tree
387 431, which I corrected and upgraded at the same time as expanding the tree
to include 573's branch.  This took a surprisingly long time, but had spin-offs
in enabling me to correct an error in one of my databases and an incorrect
assumption in another tree.  Her branch also had the interesting feature of an
apparent double bigamy, in which husband and wife both re-married while the
other was alive.  Both second marriages might have been valid, since by the
mid-19th century, the courts had developed a doctrine that if a spouse had not
been heard of for seven years, it could be presumed that he or she had died. 
What happens if the lost spouse turns up after the re-marriage creates an
interesting situation in which the re-marriage becomes legally void, but that
aspect was not relevant here, so far as is known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Further work
was done, mainly by Brian Strehlke, on the tree of New York notables (010 260),
so many thanks to him, once again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A start has
been made on extending my coverage of Whitehouses in the England &amp; Wales
Principal Probate Registry index beyond 1960.   For those unaware, there is now
a free online official index, but its search facilities are very limited, as
from 1858 to 1995 one can enter only a surname and a year: see <a
href="https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills">https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills</a>. 
This index merely brings up one by one the pages of the probate that include
the surname entered.  The WFHC probate database matches wills and
administrations in the official index to the General Register Office death
indexes, records an age at death and then calculates the year of birth.  This
enables much more rapid and focused searching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A little more
was done on the grindingly slow transcription of Whitehouse names in the
Birmingham parish rate books, concentrating largely on the gun quarter which is
St Mary's district.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Closed to
the general public, but...</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>I remain
closed for most enquiries from the general public, but I shall continue to make
exceptions from time to time, depending very much on the apparent quality and
usefulness of the information provided.  I just want to expand a bit on that theme. 
Please, if you want me to look at your tree, provide me with ALL the
information that you have, including accurate dates and places.  By that I
mean, day, month and year dates, the town of birth and death and the town and
church or other place of marriage.  Include anything known about collaterals,
that is to say the brothers and sisters of anyone born with the name of
Whitehouse and generations descending from them.  Indicate where you fit into
the tree provided.  Remember my two main rules:  I do not need descents from
female lines nor do I want details of any generation of brothers and sisters
that does not begin until 1902 or later.  (If, exceptionally, I do want to
break these rules, I'll let you know). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Whether I
&quot;admit&quot; a new enquirer to registration often depends on my assessment
of what benefit he or she will bring to my databases.  One obvious example is a
specific offer of help and its subsequent fulfilment.  New data that will
improve an existing tree to a substantial extent, is another.  An unusual
genealogical feature is a third.  In the end, it's all down to my discretion.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>One thing
that annoys me is that I decide to register someone, go through their tree, ask
for missing information that their data implies that they ought to possess, for
example details in a birth or marriage certificate, but this is followed by
silence on that person's part for weeks, even months, on end.  I make an
exception for them and then they are too busy or disorganised to reply, they
need to visit an aunt who is on holiday, their genealogy is stored in someone
else's loft and so forth.  The reason for my annoyance is that I have
familiarised myself with their tree and if they do not reply quickly, I have
forgotten about it and later have to work through it again to refresh my
memory, which consumes precious time that I have given up to help them and
others.  So, please, get organised:  assemble your information first, <u>before</u>
you approach me.  I hope that readers will forgive these somewhat stern words
and be assured that I do adopt a friendly approach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The 1939
Register</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Now for the
main topic of this newsletter: the 1939 register.  Very shortly after Great
Britain declared war on Germany, The National Registration Act was passed,
forms were filled in during the week ending 29th September 1939 and a register
compiled, to prepare for wartime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This 1939
register for England &amp; Wales has recently become available on
 Findmypast .  Unfortunately, it does not come as part of a subscription, but
has to be paid for separately with credits.  The cost of these is considerable,
working out at  6.95 for single household,  24.95 for 5 households, and  54.95
for 15 households.  The only concession to Findmypast subscribers is a 25
percent discount on the 15-household rate.  The good news, however, is that the
register can be accessed free at The National Archives, Kew.  Images cannot be
downloaded there, but they can be printed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
information given normally consists of the first forename, middle initials (but
sometimes a full second forename), surname, address, schedule number within
each household, gender, exact date of birth (day, month and year), marital
status and occupation of all those living at about 29<sup>th</sup> September
1939 who were not on duty in the armed forces.  The places of birth and
relationships are not given.  Occupations are frequently recorded in meticulous
detail, in case they could be useful in a military emergency.  A simple example
is &quot;Vertical borer Heavy lifter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The register
formed the basis for issuing identity cards (up to 1952) and was used by the
National Health Service until 1991 and updated if required, for example if a
woman on the 1939 register married subsequently, her married name is recorded. 
Unlike census returns, it does not show relationships.  A detailed article has
been published in  Family Tree , Christmas 2015 at pages 23 to 25 and Myko
Clelland of Findmypast has been giving talks to various family history
societies.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The register
is heavily redacted with black fills reading  This record is officially
closed .  The policy is not to reveal the names of anyone born later than 100
years ago from today and who is still alive.  Findmypast started with 41
million records, all blacked out, lifted those who were dead before the paper
register closed in 1991 and added those who could be identified from death
registers as dead.  This was possible because the 1939 register gives a day,
month and year date of birth and the death registers also do this from the
second quarter of 1969 onwards.  Those who died before the paper register
closed will normally have their deaths recorded in the register, as a result of
updating by the NHS.  Gradually, in weekly stages,  Findmypast have been
lifting the blackout, so that as of early January 2016 there are 30 million
records available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is a
general difference between the 1939 register and censuses, in that the register
is a moving record, not a snapshot in time.  It has moved in two different
ways.  Firstly, although it started off as a snapshot as of 29th September
1939, it was updated by the NHS when someone changed their name, usually
through marriage, or died, until 1991.  Secondly, Findmypast are moving the
records by their weekly updates, which are presumably intended to continue
until 30th September 2039 when everyone on it will be over 100 years old.   It
should be explained that a register was maintained after 1991, but has been
digitised and is not available to the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Registration
was also carried out in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but have not been
extracted by Findmypast.  To access a Scottish household, there is an official
fee of  15 for a manual search, by address.   In Northern Ireland, a Freedom of
Information request is necessary and currently (January 2016) there is a long delay,
of about 12 weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Some people
will not be found in the place expected, because of operation &quot;Pied
Piper&quot; in which over 3  million people were displaced within the first
three days of war.  Mostly, they were displaced within the United Kingdom, but some,
nearly all children, were evacuated overseas.  While these were official
evacuations, it is not known how many people moved privately. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Those who
were on active service in the armed forces and either overseas or stationed in
their property military residences, i.e. barracks, ships, airfields and so on
are not shown, but if at home on leave might be.  For example, William G N
Cutts' entry gives his occupation as &quot;F Lieut 40 Group RAF
Abing...&quot;.  (The last few characters of &quot;Abingdon&quot; were not
filmable owing to the binding of the register, a frequent occurrence.  The
entry is struck through by a red line, indicating that he died before the paper
register closed in 1991.  Sure enough, his death is registered in 1980 in
Bakewell Registration District, the GRO death index giving the same date of
birth as in the 1939 Register.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Reverting to
the updating of the register, one can sometimes see a date placed against the
changed record.  One such example reads: &quot;Ellen Butler ECIA 25.11.68 NN
BALES&quot;.  It appears that after the death of her husband, she re-married to
a Mr Bales, apparently at around 25th November 1968.  However, the date must be
merely that on which her new name (&quot;NN&quot;) was reported to the NHS.  In
fact she re-married in 1960.  Fortunately, a wide enough search was done to
capture this event in the GRO marriage index.  The significance of
&quot;ECIA&quot; is not known to me, but one might guess that it denotes
something like &quot;Evidence (of) Change In Address&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Unlike the
1911 census, normally completed by the head of household in his own hand, the
1939 register entries were written by the enumerator, a potential source of
copying error.  Usually, because of difficulties in reading the enumerator's
script, mistranscriptions are evident, as in censuses.  For instance, a search
in the surname Whitehorse, with no variations allowed, gave 13 entries, yet
this surname does not exist in England &amp; Wales, nor does Whitehonse, which
yielded a single household with 3 entries for it.  One can search with or
without surname variations:  Whitehouse gave 21999 entries with variants
allowed and 10847 without, probably rather an extreme example.  The apparently
low latter figure, compared with what would emerge from a census, is doubtless
accounted for by the redactions of children and others still alive and less
than 100 years old.</span></p>

claim 98.5%, percent accuracy in transcribing readable entries.  I do not know
what constitutes a readable entry.  I did find a clear mistranscription of the
surname Merritt as Mettitt, even though the crossing of the final two letters
did not extend backwards and the two letters &quot;r&quot; were very legible. 
This discovery was made by a search that omitted forenames and merely specified
the forename Alexander and, as another member of the household, Kate (his
wife).   That leads me on to say that it is also possible to search without any
names of people at all, for example with just a street name, and that with a
very frequent name, such as John Smith, a search by exact date of birth can be
rewarding.</span></p>

curious affair of &quot;Bert&quot;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The early
records of Herbert Whitehouse in my tree are a curious affair.  His birth was
never registered under the name Herbert.  He was baptised in October 1848 at
the same time as his younger brother Francis. Whereas, in accordance with the
family's normal practice, a date of birth was given for Francis, Herbert's date
of birth was not given.  The 1851 census records him as Herbert, aged 5, i.e.
born in 1845-46 and the 1861 census gives his age correspondingly as 15.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>However, the
birth of an Albert Whitehouse was registered in the 4th quarter of 1845 and he
was baptised on 12th November 1845.  In the 4th quarter of 1847, the twin
younger brothers of Herbert, namely Francis and Albert Tantam Whitehouse had
their births registered.  Albert Tantam Whitehouse was buried in June 1848,
aged 7 months, without being baptised.  That meant that there were two
brothers, both named Albert, alive from late 1847 to June 1848, but no
evidence, other than censuses, of Herbert's birth in 1845-46.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A plausible
explanation is as follows.  The older Albert was probably known as
&quot;Bert&quot; and the parents failed to recall that he had been registered
and baptised as Albert, rather than Herbert.  Shortly after the death of Albert
Tantam Whitehouse in June 1848, the mistake came to light, so when the surviving
twin Francis was baptised in October 1848, it was expedient to have the first
Albert re-baptised as Herbert.  Not giving his date of birth helped to cover up
the mistake.</span></p>

Whitehouse who died in July 1727 left a will, nominating his wife as sole
executrix.  The wife died before she could administer the estate.  James' son
Abraham was still a minor, so he nominated his uncle, tutor and guardian,
Richard Whitehouse to administer the estate on his behalf and a grant was made
in June 1728.  It recited that Abraham Whitehouse had attained the age of 7
years and indeed had not completed the age of 21 years and therefore was
incapable of having legal standing.  In November 1729, administration was
granted to Abraham, who subsequently married and had children in approximately
1731-2 and 1733-34.  The June 1728 grant seemed curious at first sight: 
Abraham could not have been only 7 and since he was granted the administration
the following year, he had presumably then just reached 21 and so was born
around 1709.  My explanation is that the 1728 document was merely saying that
Abraham was aged between 7 and 21.  An internet search found some authority for
7 being the age of reason, which meant in this case that he was capable of
appointing uncle Richard to act for him.  I had the administration, which was
in shorthand Latin, translated (cost  10) to satisfy my curiosity and assist
overseas correspondent 488 and the translator commented that he had seen grants
of representation (probates and administrations) made to minors.</span></p>

about wills and powers of attorney.  He said that 58 percent of people in the

which stores information about where your will is kept and is open for use by
the public as well as solicitors.  It does not store the will itself.  There is
a registration fee of  30 and they promise to keep your information for 99
years. The website is owned and operated by Data Certainty Limited, The Chapel,
Chapel Lane, Lapworth, Warwickshire B94 6EU.  Of course, the promise to store

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>On
the same general subject, it is also astonishing how few people are aware of
the desirability of making a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).  Lasting Powers
came into being in October 2007, replacing the Enduring Power of Attorney. 
Their purpose is to appoint an attorney, usually a spouse or child, to look
after your affairs when you are no longer competent to do so, for example as a
result of dementia.  Ordinary Powers of Attorney are not valid in such
circumstances.  There are two kinds of Lasting Power of Attorney, one for
property and financial affairs and the other for health and welfare.  They have
to be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) in Birmingham, at
a cost of  110 apiece.  The forms and procedure are quite complex, so most
people use a solicitor to make them, but those who are well organised, read the
forms carefully and follow the instructions can do it themselves.  It can be
done on computer or on paper, but the result is a paper document which has to
be posted to the OPG and takes at least 4 weeks to process, because notice has
to be given to various affected parties.  That's why it is so important to make
a Lasting Power of Attorney well in advance of age-related deterioration.  Once
you have lost mental capacity to make decisions, an LPA can no longer validly be
made, with the result that anyone who could have been appointed an attorney has
to apply to the Court of Protection and undergo an even more costly and complex
procedure.</span></p>

they had a son John Wallace who died in 2002.  Presumably the anonymous
submitter is a Wallace descendant.  Another child, Frederick, a lace maker aged
23, married Mabel Scott on 23rd December 1911 at Nottingham St Ann.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I
started to investigate.  I could find no marriage in the British Isles for
Frederick Whitehouse to a Louisa of any surname or to any Evesham or, as I
thought more likely, Eveson.  Still, they might have married abroad or simply
lived together without marrying, as many did.  Then I searched the GRO births
index and discovered that the tree had most of the children listed with
erroneous dates and in the wrong order.  It looked like the information came
from a private family source.  I happened to have the death certificate for
this Frederick, a hatter, who died on 10 June 1906, aged 52, at an address in
Nottingham that was the same as in the 1901 census, where he was shown as a hat
manufacturer, aged 47 and married to a Louisa.  The trouble is that he was born
in Birmingham (as was Louisa).  I tracked him back through the censuses, where
his ages were 37 in 1891 and 27 in 1881 and in both instances born in
Birmingham.  So, he was consistently two years younger than he should be and
born in the wrong place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
conclusion was clear.  This &quot;Family Search&quot; tree had not been checked
against official records and had gone wrong.  What happened, I wonder, to that
other Frederick, born near Nottingham ?  I could not find him with certainty on
any subsequent census (the Frederick at Godalming, Surrey on the 1881 census
turned out to be a Whitehorn), nor is there any convincing death registration
in the years up to 1911.  Maybe he went to sea or abroad.  If anyone out there
has any information about either Frederick, please get in touch.</span></p>

of trees</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
programme of revising Whitehouse trees has proceeded slowly.  In the early days
of the Whitehouse Family History Centre, then called the Whitehouse Information
Centre, I concentrated on events up to the 1881 census (or the US 1880 one) and
took trees little further forward in time from the people that appeared on that
census.  When the 1911 census became available, I took the decision to work
that up into a Whitehouse household spreadsheet.  Having done that I wanted to
populate it with WFHC reference numbers, which has been the main driver for
revising existing trees.   At the same time, I wanted to add more such
reference numbers to the GRO marriages file, which meant tracing forwards. 
Sorting the Marriage Details file by father's surname and forename has been a
huge factor in enabling me to do this.  Those are good aims, but the revisions
of the trees are requiring very large amounts of work.</span></p>

I have taken pity on an enquirer who has hit a massive &quot;brick wall&quot;
and registered her two days ago as number 570.  The first interesting feature
encountered was that James William Whitehouse, as he appeared on a Canadian
death certificate, was supposedly William James Whitehouse, born at Limehouse
in 1896.  However, that birth didn't exist:  he was really William Henry
Whitehouse born in 1895 at Limehouse.  His father, Henry William Whitehouse
supposedly married Emma Salmon, who turned out to be Emily Salmon and Henry
William's father, William Whitehouse, a blacksmith, did not appear in the 1841
or 1851 censuses.  My guess is that he was abroad, in the army.  Anyway, his
marriage is unique in my collection in that his wife, Ann Barber, is described
as &quot;supposed widow&quot;.  Almost needless to say, both were recorded only
as of full age.  Whether I will be able to do anything more to help this unfortunate
correspondent is highly doubtful, but it's a savage reminder that we depend so
much on luck.  Occasionally, I come across someone who is absolutely convinced
that all searches performed to date have been inadequate and that the relevant
records must exist.  Please don't laugh too loudly as it might disturb the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
case anyone is wondering, I still need help to improve my records.  One area
that I would very much like to see tackled is to extend the probate index (England
&amp; Wales) from 1961 to 1970.  This could be split into individual years. 
&quot;Ancestry&quot; has pages of the official index for 1961-66 and the new
Courts Service index covers 1967-1970 (as well as earlier years).  It's very
useful to get the entries onto a spreadsheet and correlate them with the GRO
deaths index, because there are so many Whitehouses.  No genealogical expertise
is required - only a computer, Excel, care and the ability to mimic the style
of the existing spreadsheet (for which instructions can be given).  Anyone,
anywhere in the world, could do this.</span></p>

Day fall on Boxing Day ?&quot;  It would have been better to ask &quot;Under
what circumstances ?&quot;, rather than &quot;When ?&quot;  It defeated me. 
Before using &quot;Google&quot; to find the answer, I came up with a
genealogical solution.  There was a Christmas Day, whose birth was registered
at St Ives (Huntingdonshire) in the first quarter of 1877.  I could find no early
death in FreeBMD and was encouraged to find a marriage in 1901 in the same
Registration District.  My answer was that when babies learn to walk, they
usually fall over.  It would be reasonable to assume that he was born on 25th
December 1876, so a year later would very likely be falling over.  Thus,
Christmas Day might well have fallen on Boxing Day 1877.  I wonder whether it
was a nice day when he married a Mary J. Merryweather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Here
in the London area, we have been enjoying some fine late summer weather, lately
with a few merciful showers.  They are merciful, because the garden is very
dry, but despite that we have had some excellent late runner beans and
courgettes.  Earlier, we had a tremendous crops of plums.  Our best tree is the
cooking plum &quot;Rivers Early Prolific&quot;, a wonderful tasty variety from
the early 1900s, seldom seen in the shops today.  My parents had one and one of
my first actions when moving house in 1983 was to plant one myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
good weather has enabled me to make a lot of progress with a garden landscaping
project in which I have demolished some ugly brick walls and am creating a
raised bed for a vegetable plot.  It all started with a request from my
neighbour to take down some ivy which had intruded into his plot and was
climbing over his garage wall and onto its flat roof.  This ivy, being very
old, had thick and extensive roots and had wrecked about 4 metres of fence. 
Even the concrete fence posts were crumbling and had to be removed before work
on the vegetable plot could be started.  I need to make further progress while
the good weather continues, so the website update might take several days to
complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Collateral
line research pays off</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I
have always said that I am not basically a researcher for these Whitehouse
trees, leaving that to my correspondents who &quot;own&quot; them.  Despite
that, I do have to do some, to make good inadequacies and correct errors.  Many
are interested only or primarily in their direct line of descent and not at all
wanting to hear about the collateral lines, that is to say brothers and sisters
of those in the direct line and their descendants.  I have always thought that
rather short-sighted.  If I had not pursued the full breadth of many of my own
family trees, I would have failed to uncover vital information, including in my
Whitehouse tree the entries in a much prized family bible and in another line
an ancient tree compiled by a remote cousin.   A recent example occurred only
yesterday when I visited the London Family History Centre and took the
opportunity to check some matters in Tree 005 303.  Briefly, William
Whitehouse, a glove maker in Worcester City had married Mary of unknown surname
in the 1780s and I could find no obvious marriage in the area.  They had many
children including William (baptised 1790), from whom my two correspondents
were descended and Martha (baptised 1786), who appeared to have married one
Charles Clarke in 1811.  To make this tree more complete in the collateral
lines, I wanted to check whether there were any children of this marriage. 
This being a female line, I would enter &quot;Issue&quot; if there were any.  A
quick look in &quot;Family Search&quot; revealed several including a Mary Foler
Clarke baptised in 1818.  Foler seemed an odd forename.  I reviewed the
possible marriages for William and Mary Whitehouse outside Worcestershire. 
They included one in London at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, which is
situated on Trafalgar Square.  It didn't seem worth investigating until I saw
that this Mary was a Mary Foley Harris.  &quot;FindmyPast&quot; has images of
Westminster Marriages, so I was able to find that this William Whitehouse was
of the parish of Worcester St Peter.  Surely this must be the right one,
despite the discrepancy between Foler and Foley.  So I searched on microfilm
for the baptisms of the Clarke children and found Mary Foley Clarke:  Foler was
a mistranscription.  All this would never have happened if I had not bothered
with the collateral line from Martha.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Anyhow,
I also want to broaden out the trees as much as reasonably possible, so as to
index events to my database files and thus provide the maximum help to those
who visit my website.  Originally, I took trees no further forward in time than
the 1881 census, except in the direct line of the correspondent.  Now, I am
trying to index trees to the 1911 census, which means investigating marriages
and census returns up to then and results in a great deal of updating, which
has been very time-consuming.</span></p>

of the 1911 census reminds me of my rather belated discovery that my 1911
census file does not always display the whole of the contents of a cell within
the spreadsheet, only in the formula bar, even when the Row Height is on Auto. 
My daughter says that this is a known problem in Excel and I think it must be
connected with my decision to use a rather small font (Arial 7 point) in this
database, in order to fit its many columns to landscape A4 pages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I
have been thinking about undertaking a further extension forwards in time of my
England &amp; Wales Probate Index which runs from 1858 to 1960. 
&quot;Ancestry&quot; has taken its indexing forward to 1966.  I asked the
Principal Probate Registry for permission to photograph the Whitehouse entries
in their index from 1967 to 1980.  Here is their reply:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&quot;I
have spoken with the Southern Group Probate Manager Mrs Diane Rice, who has
confirmed that is it not permissible to photocopy the probate indexes. However,
it is expected that the 4 million records in the indexes from 1996 - present
day will be online at the end of September and this may be of use to you. The
remaining 41 million documents are expected to go online at the end of
December.&quot;  That will be a huge boon, even though they are only indexes. 
The reason that I want to continue my own database is that I link the probate
to the GRO deaths index and then, within each forename, sort it according to
calculated year of birth.  That makes searching for the right Whitehouse much
easier.  Whether I will find time to make the extension is another matter
entirely and one where I could sorely use some help.  The work could be done
entirely at home.  Sadly, I get very few offers of help these days.  Those that
I do are much valued and receive public thanks on this website.</span></p>

book is unindexed and likely to remain so for a considerable time.  It is
highly relevant to confirming a collateral line of my own family tree and I
have been examining it for clues about my direct line of ancestry.  I think I
am right in saying that the schedule numbers in the Rates Book are real house
numbers, thus making this the first full address list for the central part of
the town.  Unfortunately, many Whitehouse forenames are missing - whether a
forename is included or not seems to be a matter of the rate collector's whim. 
However, some can be matched to earlier years or directories.  I plan to create
a street index that includes all the various courts.  The book is quite
instructive in showing the staggering growth of housing in the town centre by
the addition of courts.</span></p>

of Poplar.  He married Harriet Potter on 31 March 1878, at Bow St Stephen, as
Thomas, a printer, and the 1881 census says the same.  On the 1891 census he
became Edwin, a decorator, in 1901 he was William. a general dealer.  He was
not found on the 1911 census and was not with his family then.  When his son,
Arthur, married in 1912, the certificate showed him as John, a painter.  Was he
being chased by creditors ?  I wonder whether someone out there knows the

<p class=MsoNormal>It s six months since I updated the website, during which

batch of trees that came in during the first three months, when I also had to

website, of which more below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Closed for enquiries and new registrations</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have already announced that from 1st April, I would not be
answering enquiries or admitting new correspondents for registration.  There
might be a very occasional exception to allow registration, if the context is
unusual or the information provided is of high genealogical merit.  Thus, I did
make one exception in the last three months, for new correspondent 569, in
strange genealogical circumstances.  Correspondent 167 is descended from Joseph
Whitehouse who married Edith Bazire at a Register Office in 1908, but I
discovered that Joseph had apparently left his wife, whom he married in 1889,
and at least one of his children to do so.  His first wife was undoubtedly
still alive at the 1911 census, according to which she was married to another
man (no such marriage found).  Correspondent 569 is descended from one of
Joseph s three children by his first wife.  This story has further to run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Very many thanks</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the right moment to thank all who have helped me at
one time or another by transcribing records at record offices remote from
London, visiting churches etc.  The last helper, correspondent 557, kindly
visited the new Library of Birmingham and the new archives near Dudley (which
opened in January near the Black Country Museum), so particular thanks to him. 
He also inspired me to create the new Whitehouse forename files referred to
below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also owe a big debt of gratitude to correspondent 561, who
did extensive research on the Kentucky pioneer, James Whitehouse, which has
improved the tree 137 etc. of the many people descended from him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Half-yearly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the problems mentioned above, it has been an active
period, with 11 new correspondents (558 to 568) registered before the 31st
March deadline expired (including two on the last day !) plus No. 569
aforesaid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The principal new records include a GRO (1837-1911)
marriages file of those who have Whitehouse as a forename.  This takes the same
form as the Whitehouse surname file, whereby there is an accompanying marriage
details file.  This new GRO marriages file for the Whitehouse forename in
England &amp; Wales shows about 93 percent of spouses, which is as good as the
surname file.  However, the proportion for which full details are given is only
32 percent as present.  As before, the existence of the full details is shown
by an  f  and the forename marriages are referenced with WFHC correspondent
numbers.  This referencing might not be complete, so it would be useful to know
of any additional ones needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three further  miscellaneous  records have been added, all
thanks to the indexing provided by volunteers at the Stafford Record Office. 
They relate to the prisoners awaiting trial at the Staffordshire quarter
sessions, the Staffordshire police and the beginnings of an index of
registrations of canal boatmen under the 1795 Act.  These data are full
extracts compiled from ledgers at the Record Office.  The prisoner records are
a glimpse of social history, showing that petty theft led to very severe
sentences.  Prison was never a simple matter of being locked in a cell, as it
was always accompanied by  hard labour , which meant long days on a treadmill,
sometimes to no purpose at all.  Whether at Stafford the treadmill was used to
drive mill wheels, say to grind corn, I don t know, but I gather that in many
prisons it was not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another interesting development has been the digitisation
and filming of records at the Shropshire Record Office.  I took advantage of
this to improve a record that I started on my computer some while ago, with the
result that Whitehouse marriages in the 1754-1837 period (from the Hardwick
Marriage Act to the beginning of civil registration) are now covered in detail
in the four counties, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and
Worcestershire (M WMIDS-SAL 1754-1837).  This file has the full details
including witnesses, whether the parties signed or made mark and whether the
marriage was by licence.  Shropshire was (and still is) very rural, with a
great many small country parishes.  Not all have been filmed and I did manage
to locate one marriage which was not.  There are probably one or two others, so
I cannot guarantee 100 percent coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, the marriage details file for civil registration
in England &amp; Wales has been slowly improving, bringing coverage of full
essential details* of these marriages, from 1st July 1837 to 1911, to 7009
marriages (79 percent).  The total number is a slightly  cheating  statistic,
as the Whitehouse-Whitehouse marriages are doubly indexed and so counted
twice.  Additionally, there are partial details of another 16 and a small
amount for another 5.  As I keep saying, a big advantage of the marriage
details file is that it can be sorted by name of the father.  The proportion of
marriages for which spouses are shown, with or without full details of the
marriage, has risen from 92 to 93 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>* Whether signed or made mark and the name of the clergyman
or registrar have been omitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The future of the WFHC</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>1. Archiving</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As previously stated, the intention is to archive the
trees.  First, they need updating, especially at the modern end.  This is a
surprisingly time-consuming task, as I need to follow collateral lines of
Whitehouses through to the 1911 census and reference them to my 1911 census
database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>2. Improving the records</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the same time, my records need to be improved.  The 1911
census is a case in point.  I compiled it using the FindmyPast index, making
corrections as necessary.  One particular task is to do a pilot study into
comparing my database against the Ancestry index.  This is an area where I
could use some help.  The proposal is to take a Whitehouse forename which is
not too frequent, say Alfred or David, sort my 1911 census database accordingly,
print out that section and then try to compare this with the Ancestry index. 
One could start by looking at any entry for which the age in Ancestry is not
one found in the printout or, if the same, is obviously not for the same
person.  A direct comparison will always be possible by bringing up the image
in Ancestry and comparing the address and other information with the printout. 
This would be interesting research in its own right, for the bearing it might
have on other surnames.  Any offers ?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another area requiring input is parish registers, especially
baptisms and burials in the West Midlands.  I want to cover Coseley, Darlaston,
Oldbury, Smethwick, Walsall and Wednesbury, especially by checking the indexes
from Family Search and Ancestry, and making full extracts, as already done for
Dudley, West Bromwich and Tipton.  I have little hope of finding time to do
this myself and look to my readers for help, please.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An on-going project of my own is the old Birmingham Rate
Books, where going is slow anyway as the unindexed books have to be trawled.  I
do plan to try to bring this to a suitable stopping point during the autumn or
winter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>3.  Service to correspondents</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I plan to continue to answer enquiries and receive new
information from registered correspondents.  I shall also try to advise them
when any significant amendment is made to their tree, if they keep their
e-address up to date.  I envisage that at some time I shall collect together
all my updated trees which are ready for archiving and put them on the website,
so as to provide  self-service .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>4.  The website</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This will continue to be updated from time to time, not
necessarily every quarter.  These newsletters do have a few fans, amazingly and
so long as there is something to say, I hope to continue them, probably at
irregular intervals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Was his father Abraham ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1839 a John Whitehouse was in Stafford Gaol, accused of
riot and assaulting a constable.  The calendar of prisoners records that he was
otherwise known as  Jacob s ladder .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 7th
January 2014</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>All good things&nbsp;</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been very enjoyable corresponding with you all and
writing these newsletters.  However, I have decided, with great reluctance, but
a sense of realism, that I must concentrate my time on my own family trees and
on revising my Whitehouse trees for archiving.  Accordingly, the registration
system will cease at midnight British Summer Time on 31st March 2014, queries
from the general public will not be answered, but correspondence with existing
correspondents will continue so long as they keep their contact information up
to date.  Hitherto, if an e-mail bounces, I have tried to contact the
correspondent by telephone or, in extreme circumstances, by letter.  Such
contact attempts will cease.  The website will remain and will be updated at
around the end of March and subsequently from time to time, probably at
irregular intervals, and I shall be putting some of the revised trees on it.  
I hope also to do some tidying up work on the records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Office 2013</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anyone is thinking of upgrading to this software, my
advice is don t, unless you are an experienced and skilled user of Office or
unless you are compelled to do so by force of circumstance.  It is designed for
people who want to do complicated operations, with the result that the simple
ones, assuming that you can find them amid all the bells and whistles, take
longer.  For example, there is no drawing toolbar in Excel 2013 and although
various things can be put on a quick access toolbar, drawing lines cannot. 
When a new drawing line is put onto one of my family trees, it shows it in
blue, even when the default font for the sheet is set to black, so the line
colour has to be set manually to black.  Much of the layout is non-intuitive. 
The whole thing seems to operate at two levels by providing pre-set formats for
headers and page layouts (presumably for those who can t make their own
customised templates), yet incredibly sophisticated ranges of tools accessible
on buttons.  I shall persevere with it, storing documents in  Compatibility
Mode   so that they are readable in earlier versions of Office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>An unregistered church  marriage </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A civil marriage ceremony of a Whitehouse at Liverpool
Register Office on 29 Jul 1901 was  confirmed  in a church ceremony at Wrexham
St Giles on 31 Dec 1902.  The vicar added a note that the entry was to be
removed from the register before it was sent to the District Registrar.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A strange GRO marriage index entry</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have deleted a marriage from my index (UN 1313) because
the Whitehouse in the GRO index turned out to be a Stephenson, for no obvious
reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>&nbsp;Conventions used in my trees</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Issue  is genealogy-speak for a child or children and I
use it regardless of the number of children, their gender and the length of
time for which the child(ren) have survived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spellings of what is clearly the same surname can differ,
especially in the period before about 1860.  I use the legal name of the
person, which I take to be that in which his birth was registered, where known,
and if before civil registration, the name in which he was baptised.  So, for
example, in a recent revision of a tree,  Duncombe  was changed to  Duncomb ,
the latter having been used in baptisms the civil registration&nbsp;of the
particular people named in the tree.  This is also why Meshach the elder in
that tree was written as Meshack, but his son as Meschach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where I have not found either a reasonably probable baptism
or a birth registration, I fall back on the name used at marriage if that looks
sensible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The file names used in the trees include a date written as
yymmdd, a format that I find useful to make sure, amid the many different
pieces of software used, that everything is placed in date order in my files. 
The same convention is used on my website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I work to the standard of reasonable probability, i.e. more
probable than not, which happens to be the standard used in civil law in
English-speaking countries.  It differs from the requirement of  beyond
reasonable doubt  in criminal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Frequently asked questions</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some correspondents enquire whether the tree that I send
them can be taken further back in time.  They are drawn up to the best of my
ability at the time, but it is always possible that an assiduous researcher
could do more, especially if there have been improvements in the availability
of public records on-line since the tree was drawn up.  Please bear in mind
that I am basically an indexer and an archivist and that I draw up trees and
try to improve them for the purpose of accurate indexing and archiving.  It
remains the responsibility of correspondents to do their own research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others enquire whether anyone with a connection to their
tree has registered since they were last in touch with me.  The practice
hitherto has always been that I will put newly registered correspondents in
touch with all existing ones that are connected, i.e. (usually) distant
cousins.  This will continue until 31st March 2014, but cease thereafter, as
new enquiries will not be answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Report for the period 5th August 2013 to date</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am happy to report good progress with the records.  West
Bromwich burials have been extended to cover the same period as Dudley, namely
1813-61 and all the Anglican churches there.  The marriage indexes have made
excellent progress, too, so that the proportion of Whitehouse marriages in
England &amp; Wales in the registration period of 1837 to 1911 with the full
details transcribed has reached 79% to the nearest whole number and the
proportion with assigned spouses 92%.  Work has continued on the Birmingham
Rate Books and a new file has been established in which the older Birmingham
directories have been extracted.  A correspondent enquired about the origins of
the name Whitehouse, so I have written a short piece about that, which can be
accessed from the opening page of the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 5 newcomers who have been registered, with
references 553 to 557, the latter being the total number of correspondents on
my register.  Both 556 and 557 presented me with interesting obstacles, when I
failed to find a couple of marriages.  In 556 s tree, one father named  Eliza 
in my spreadsheet escaped previous notice.  I located the transcript and found
that it had not been done by me.  Someone had misread  Elijah , an error which
leads me to suspect that several other entries by this transcriber need to be
checked.  The puzzle in the 557 tree was that the bride Whitehouse s father was
shown as John, when he should have been Samuel, yet there could be no doubt,
from several later censuses, that the marriage was correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both trees were attended by the familiar problems with
mis-transcriptions of censuses by Ancestry:  the value of using the Whit* (* =
wild card) method and also using forename only remains in force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 4th
August 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What s all this - a newsletter and website update in August
?  Well, it s effectively the end of quarter newsletter running two months
early, as I have decided to close most Whitehouse FHC operations during August
and September.  This is partly to give me a bit of a rest after several years
of very intensive work on Whitehouse records.  It is partly also to let me get
used to my new computer, Windows 7 Pro and Office 2013.  In the last quarterly
newsletter, I mentioned that my 7-year old computer had had a seizure, causing
a very slow start-up.  I still don t know what the matter is with it, despite
spending quite a bit of time on the problem, but it was out of date anyway and
running on the doomed Windows XP operating system.  Some of my correspondents
have thanked me for mentioning that Microsoft is withdrawing support for
Windows XP on 8th April 2014.  They are also withdrawing support for Office
2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shall maintain a good service for all new enquiries during
the closure period.  Existing correspondents are welcome to e-mail me, but
replies will be delayed until October, unless the reply impinges on something
else which needs more prompt attention.  Please remember that if you omit the
subject line or give a more general or vague one, your e-mail could be deleted <u>unopened</u>,
even if I recognise the sender.  A few correspondents have sent e-mails on
non-Whitehouse subjects to everyone in their address book.  A few appear to
have had their address book hi-jacked by a virus or worm, causing annoying
e-mails to be sent to me.  One or two have sent me repeated invitations to
 Linked-in , which I routinely ignore, no matter how much I like the person
concerned.  All such e-mails are deleted unopened.  The recommended subject
line is  WHITEHOUSE - xxx , where  xxx  is the correspondent number or, for new
enquiries,  NEW ENQUIRY .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just to emphasise and thereby avoid misunderstanding, I
hope, I positively want new enquirers to register with me as correspondents and
it is rare that I cannot contribute something to their Whitehouse family
history.  Very often, I can add quite a lot and sometimes I find that my
correspondent has made a mistake, which I can correct.  There are still a very
few people who contact me, but do not want to register.  It s seldom that I
know why.  Registered correspondents are not bombarded with e-mails - I would
guess they get about one every year or two on average, when I update the tree. 
Their e-mail addresses are not disclosed to anyone except those who have a
genuine relationship defined by a WFHC tree.  Telephone numbers are never
disclosed (except on rare occasions when the correspondent has given
permission).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next year or so, I shall be working at a much slower
rate and devoting more time to my own genealogy.&nbsp; The main WFHC
requirement now is for me to update as many trees as possible, improving the
referencing of marriages and the 1911 census with WFHC reference numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amusingly, in view of my remarks last time, a decent summer
did start on the 4th July, at least for the south east of England and today is
yet another nice day.  England are struggling in the 3rd test match (cricket)
against Australia, so what we need now is for torrential rain over Manchester. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Report for the period 28th June to 4th August 2013</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been a quiet period.  Nominally, there has been one
new correspondent, an existing correspondent with a second Whitehouse tree,
which has been given the WFHC number 552.  I say  nominally , because I was
delighted to hear from a new correspondent (WFHC 193) who has replaced the
previous correspondent, a near cousin, alas deceased many years ago, with no
change of the reference number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Records-wise, I have improved the Dudley baptisms index.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three trees have been subjected to very extensive updating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A jocular newscast ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was thinking about my good friend, correspondent 552 s,
family story about a jockey by the name of George Whitehouse who rode the
outsider  Hotspur  to second place in the Derby at Epsom in 1849.  I wonder
whether he ever rode again.  This triggered a memory of a recent news item on
the TV about a jockey who had a serious fall from a horse and was taken to
hospital, where he was said to be in a stable condition.</p>

2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunshine and Wimbledon tennis at last.&nbsp; The saying that
it always rains during Wimbledon fortnight has been a myth in recent
years.&nbsp; Yes, it has rained on one or two days, but on the whole the
weather has been reasonable.&nbsp; I always reckon that if we are going to get
a decent summer, it usually starts on the 4th July, an easily memorable
date.&nbsp; Alas, here I am, not getting my ration of Vitamin D from the sun,
as I have had to try to get as much on the computer and backed up as
possible.&nbsp; The poor old thing had a seizure about 10 days ago and ever
since then Windows start-up has been very slow (40 minutes).&nbsp; I think it
got too hot and either lost some memory or a component in the normal start-up
pathway.&nbsp; It has served me well for 7 years, but its 32-bit processor and
1 GB RAM are out of date and it runs on Windows XP, which is doomed: Microsoft
is withdrawing support on 8th April 2014.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been working pretty hard for the last 15 months or
so, improving the records on this website and am at least a year ahead of my
own expectations.&nbsp; For the next year or so, I shall be working at a much
slower rate and devoting more time to my own genealogy.&nbsp; The main WFHC
requirement now is for me to update as many trees as possible, improving the
referencing marriages and the 1911 census with WFHC reference numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anyone who has  Ancestry  to hand and would like to help,
a very useful service would be to take a small portion of the WFHC 1911 census
file and check it.&nbsp; The present version has been drawn up largely with the
aid of the  Findmypast  index.&nbsp; It does contain some material not in that
index and  Findmypast  indexing errors have been corrected, but a check against
 Ancestry  would be both helpful and interesting.&nbsp; It would probably be
best to take a small selection of a particular forename between defined ages
(or, of course, the whole forename if it is a rare one).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been a momentous quarter for Whitehouse records at
the WFHC, with many projects either completed or near completion.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1911 census transcription of households containing at
least one Whitehouse has been completed.&nbsp; It contains 11410 people of that
name and runs to 16878 rows.&nbsp; At 4.59MB it s a substantial download and in
my hands prints out at 407 pages.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another long-felt want achieved this quarter has been
extending my probate index for England &amp; Wales by 10 years, so that it now
runs from 1858 to 1960 instead of 1950.&nbsp; This doesn t seem much when thus
baldly stated, but it has increased by a third.&nbsp; Converting the printed
entries in the official index books to spreadsheet form is hard going, as
everything has to be typed.&nbsp; It s worth reminding everyone that the big
advantage of this index over that of  Ancestry  is that most of it is
searchable by the date of birth of the deceased.&nbsp; That s because the date
of death given in the probate index has been matched with the GRO death index
entry and the age at death subtracted.&nbsp; Of course, it s only a rough
guide, since ages at death are often given inaccurately, but in practice it
works pretty well.&nbsp; The next step will be to populate the extension with
WFHC reference numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parish records in Dudley, Tipton and West Bromwich parishes
have been extended very considerably.&nbsp; The non-conformist parts of the
present files just uploaded need some further work.&nbsp; Some of this needs
doing at the Smethwick archives, so if there is a volunteer ....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to thank publicly Aaron Murray (WFHC 311) for his
sterling work on marriages in the Ontario province of Canada of Whitehouses
born in England.&nbsp; It is quite surprising just how many can be referenced
to WFHC trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another thankee is Rebecca at the Staffordshire Record
Office in conjunction with Diana Grant, a volunteer helper there.&nbsp; Rebecca
has enabled me to improve my Apprentices index by transcribing parts of Diana s
index that were not included in the online version provided for public
use.&nbsp; I am very grateful to them both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anyone is going to the Staffordshire Record Office, there
is a small discrepancy that needs looking at:&nbsp; it just means ordering up
the Wednesbury poor law documents and looking at one apprenticeship indenture
which is identified by an SRO reference number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have managed to add a couple more years to the Birmingham
Rate Books files.&nbsp; Trawling them is slow going and it is all too easy to
miss an entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the background to all this, the marriage indexes covering
1st July 1837 to the end of 1911 in England and Wales have been steadily
improved, with more spouses added and more entries in the marriage details
file.&nbsp; Also, Pat Molloy (WFHC 409) has checked a couple of marriages at
Lichfield Cathedral for me, so many thanks to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 6 new correspondents this quarter, bringing the
total to 551.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More bigamy&nbsp;</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two new correspondents (WFHC 547 &amp; 548) arrived in April
and were duly linked to existing WFHC trees, in each of which there is a well
documented case of bigamy in the first part of the 19th century.&nbsp; Divorce
was impossible for the ordinary man and woman in those days.&nbsp; This
accounts for many fictitious husbands and wives in census returns and it seems
difficult to be censorious about one of the parties wanting to legitimise the
new relationship.  At some point in the mid-19th century, the courts developed
a rule that if a spouse disappeared and had not been heard of for 7 years and
if reasonable enquiries had been made, it could be presumed by the abandoned
spouse that he or she was free to re-marry.  Mind you, if the deserter turned
up later, after the second marriage, there could be dreadful complications !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Footballing legend</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are few famous Whitehouses, but, thanks to new
correspondent 547, I found another.&nbsp; Jimmy Whitehouse, a goalkeeper for
the Lancashire football club of Newton Heath in the period 1899-1903, played
about 60 first team games.&nbsp; What s so wonderful about a appearing for a
potty little club like that ?&nbsp; In 1902 it became Manchester United.&nbsp;
So, Jimmy, having played for Manchester United, is clearly a football legend
!&nbsp; We can forget the end of his career in 1907 at the lowly Southend
United and the 1911 census entry in which he is shown as a fish dock labourer
in Grimsby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Family Search: brickbats and a bouquet</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter I was puzzled by not being able to find in the
register Whitehouses baptised in the Somerset parish of Laverton, as shown in
Family Search.&nbsp; Eventually, a flash of inspiration arrived and I found
them in Langport parish !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another Family Search mystery affected my own tree: a film
relating to Birmingham St Philip contained some burials from 1793 to
1812.&nbsp; They had been catalogued as taking place at St Philip, along with
many other items on the film.&nbsp; However, they actually took place at St
Mary, Whittall Street, which was then a chapelry within St Martin s parish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, their relatively new index of Tipton St
Martin baptisms seems highly accurate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Bureaucracy then as now</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Found in the Birmingham Rate book for 1810-13 at New John
Street:  Part of this house in Aston and part in Birmingham that part in Birg
[Birmingham] is about one fourth the which is here rated. &nbsp; The rateable
value was thus set at  3 for the Birmingham part.&nbsp; Sense was seen and a
note was added in 1811:  this house is now placed entirely in Aston parish .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A great survivor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following note appears in the Dudley St Thomas burials
register, for William Bunn on 20th December 1857:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Survived with broken spine &amp; two broken thighs nearly
ten years and died in the Faith .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

style='font-size:24.0pt'>WHITEHOUSE FAMILY HISTORY CENTRE</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 27th
March 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hope that all of you in the UK are keeping warm in this,
the coldest prolonged spell of weather for 50 years.&nbsp; I have been
afflicted with the worst cold (in the head) of my life.&nbsp; It began by
leaving me deaf in one ear and lasted about 3 weeks 5 days, after which I was
relieved to regain my hearing.&nbsp; All is well now, however.&nbsp;
Genealogically, I have managed a few trips to the London Family History Centre,
run by the LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints).&nbsp; This is
located on the first floor of The National Archives, at Kew.&nbsp; One of the
more enjoyable aspects of going there is the pleasant walk along the Thames
towpath, where one can see rowing crews practising and birds flying low over
the river.&nbsp;&nbsp; My own Whitehouse family history, on which I have been
busy, has required me to look at the Birmingham rate books there.&nbsp; They
have been filmed by the LDS, but it is slow going, as they are not
indexed.&nbsp; I have done quite a bit of extraction and made up a couple of
files, described below.&nbsp; Enough of this chit-chat, as it is now 8.30 p.m.
and I want to get the website updated tonight...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly Report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter I have improved the Apprentices Index by
covering the years 1774 to 1810 in the Inland Revenue Stamp Duty ledgers.&nbsp;
The subject is explained in detail in the MISC EXPLANATIONS file.&nbsp; The
WFHC index contains some apprenticeships extracted from the Staffordshire
Record Office index, which, unfortunately, does not give as much detail as the
Inland Revenue ledgers.&nbsp; The SRO have advised that to complete all the
missing details except the sum paid for the apprenticeship would take1 hour,
while to discover the sum paid would take 2 to 2-1/2 hours (probably because
the indentures themselves would have to be consulted).&nbsp; An offer of help
to do either would be very welcome.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New this quarter is an index of Whitehouse entries in the
London Gazette.&nbsp; I am very grateful to Alma Ranson (WFHC 542) for her
considerable work on this.&nbsp; This is a substantial file covering the period
1734 (first Whitehouse entry) up to 1860.&nbsp; Most of the entries relate to
bankruptcies and changes to partnerships.&nbsp; It has been quite a revelation
to me how many names, from trees in my collection, that I recognised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another new type of database relates to Birmingham
Rates.&nbsp; Rates were collected in Birmingham from way back in the 18th
century to fund necessary relief for the poor and are consequently often
referred to as  Poor rates .&nbsp; I have extracted Whitehouses for six years,
namely 1787-1792 and 1801-02.&nbsp; (The rating year ran to Lady Day, which was
25th March, so  1801-02  means 26th March 1801 to 25th March 1802). &nbsp;These
books are, in effect, directories of Birmingham, as they cover not only those
who paid the rates, but those who did not.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they do not
give occupations, but to some extent they can be reconciled with trade
directories, which do.&nbsp; In the 5-year period 1787-92, Birmingham was still
quite a small town and it was interesting that many Whitehouses stayed in the
same or a nearby street for the whole period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The file of West Midlands marriages from 1754 (26th March)
to 1837 (30th June) has been improved considerably by the kind efforts of Brian
Morris (WFHC 518) who has checked in Parish Registers many of the Mid- and North
Staffordshire marriages that were previously entered only from transcripts or
an index.&nbsp; As a result some more details have been added, errors corrected
and queries determined.&nbsp; Very many thanks to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another helper to be thanked is Antoinette Betteridge (WFHC
431), who has extracted another 11 Derbyshire marriages in the period 1870 to
1909, which have been added to the marriage details file and duly marked  f  in
the GRO marriages index.&nbsp; This index continues to improve steadily and
currently offers the full details of about 77 percent of Whitehouse marriages
in the 1st July 1837 to end of 1911 period.&nbsp; Marriages with named spouses
amount to some 91 percent.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many thanks to Sarah Riley (WFHC 080) for sending me the
full details of Whitehouse baptisms from the Wednesbury Wesleyan Methodist
registers.&nbsp; There are just 9 of them, dated 1805 to 1836.&nbsp; Since
Methodist Ministers were assigned to  circuits  (groups of churches), the
Wednesbury circuit covered many other places.&nbsp; In these nine Whitehouse baptisms,
three are in the Great Wyrley &amp; Cheslyn Hay area (Charles, son of George
&amp; Mary, 1805; Mary, daughter of James &amp; Ann, 1811; and Ann, daughter of
Edward, Edge Tool Maker, &amp; Sarah, 1818), one is at Bloxwich (William, son
of William &amp; Mary, 1820); two are in the Sedgley area (Ruth, daughter of
Philip &amp; Mary, 1817; and William, son of Josiah, Bricklayer &amp; Sarah,
1836), two are at Great Bridge (Sarah, daughter of John, Forgeman &amp; Mary;
and James, son of Abraham, Mason and Eliza, 1833) and just one is at Wednesbury
(Hezekiah, son of John &amp; Elizabeth of Wood Green, 1829).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest thank you of all must go to David Whitehouse
(WFHC 512), who has transcribed Whitehouse households in the 1880 census of
Maine, USA, the most populous for this name.  It was a mammoth undertaking. 
Inspired by this outstanding help, I got to work myself on some of the other
states, with the result that this transcription of the 1880 census is now
complete for the whole of the USA, after some 3-1/2 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The project to transcribe Whitehouse-containing households
on the 1911 census has made another big stride forward and now offers 96
percent coverage of England, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel
Islands.&nbsp; There are just 137 households in Wolverhampton Registration District
remaining to be put on the spreadsheet. &nbsp;Otherwise, it is complete for all
households indexed by  Findmypast  and a few that it missed out.&nbsp; The
commonest deviant renderings of the surname have been covered.&nbsp; It s worth
repeating here that if your search in online databases has not yielded the
result expected, try WFHC s.&nbsp; Just to take two recent examples, you would
have a problem finding Lilian Whitehouse, aged 7, living at Birmingham Road,
Aldridge, Staffs, if you searched in  Ancestry , as the surname has been
transcribed by them as Whikhouse and Thomas James Whitehouse, a coal miner born
in 1870 living at at Pelsall, Staffordshire, whose forenames have been rendered
by  Ancestry  as Thomas Jane !&nbsp; Another advantage of the WFHC spreadsheet
is that forenames have been  normalised , with the correction of householders 
as well as transcription errors.&nbsp; For instance, Irvine Whitehouse, born in
1904 appears with his correct forename, rather than Irine as appears in the
census schedule or Irene as misinterpreted by  Findmypast .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It s strange to report that I have registered only one new
correspondent, who was given the number 155, a number vacated by my decision
that a particular tree did not need two references.&nbsp; So, overall the
number of registered correspondents remains at 546.&nbsp; I am constantly
surprised that more people do not ask to be registered.&nbsp; After all, I will
help with the tree, often doing a little research myself, there are no
formalities such as user names and passwords, the correspondent does not have
to do anything after the initial phase when I might ask for some details for
the tree, there is no charge for services rendered and e-mails are sent only
when the tree is updated or a new correspondent joins the tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Shropshire Parish Registers to go online</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I asked the Shropshire Archives in Shrewsbury about their
progress in digitising Shropshire parish registers and reproduce their response
below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Thanks for your enquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are in the process of digitisation - the final batch of
registers are going to Scotland next week.&nbsp; Once all registers are
digitised, we still have the process of indexing. Final decisions have yet to
be made on who will do this and when the registers will be available to view
on-line and through which provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, it is not possible to say when registers for
Shropshire will be fully searchable on line, but it is likely to be within the
next year.&nbsp; Details will appear on our website when there is more news. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='color:black'>The recording of marriages in
Victorian times</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Many people probably do not
realise that the marriage certificates issued by the General Register Office
for England &amp; Wales are copies.&nbsp; The only original registers, where
you can see the signatures of the parties and witnesses in their own handwriting,
are those signed in duplicate in church.&nbsp; One is kept at an official
depositary serving as the Diocesan Record Office (Archives, Local studies
etc.), except that, annoyingly, a few churches have retained them, and the
other at the District Register Office.&nbsp; This might or might not be the
same District Register Office for the area at the time of the marriage, since
the jurisdictions of these Offices have often changed over the years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The system is explained by Michael
Whitfield Foster in his book  A Comedy of Errors, Act 2  (Published 2002,
privately in Wellington, New Zealand, by the author:&nbsp; ISBN 0-473-07480-X;
see <a href="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/mikefost/">http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/mikefost/</a>
) at pages 17 &amp; 18:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> On completion of each quarter, clergy and registrars (and
officials of the Jewish &amp; Quaker congregations) were required to copy out
all the...&nbsp; ...marriages for that quarter on loose sheets [reference to
the 1998 book of the same author] and give them to the Superintendent Registrar
of their district.&nbsp; The clergy were trusted to sign their quarterly
returns to certify them as true copies, while the returns by local registrars
were checked and certified by the Superintendent Registrar.&nbsp; It is this
certification that is meant by the second occurrence of the word  certified  in
the wording on all certificates issued by the GRO, namely  certified to be a
true copy of an entry in the certified copy of a register...   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> The Superintendent Registrars passed the returns [on the
loose sheets] to the General Register Office and kept no copies of them.&nbsp;
When the marriage registers were finally filled (the clergy held two copies),
one copy was sent to the Superintendent Registrar for permanent safe-keeping
and was locally indexed.&nbsp; Some registers in small parishes have not yet
been completed since they were first issued in 1837 and both copies are still
held in those parishes.&nbsp; Registrars had only single registers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For an explanation of how the loose sheets were arranged by
the GRO clerks, please refer to my paper  Marriage Mining in the West
Midlands , which can be accessed via a link on the index page.&nbsp; For horror
stories of official errors, missed entries etc., see Mike Foster s book cited
above and its 1998 predecessor,  A comedy of errors .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Jewish marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Has anyone found a Jewish marriage of a Whitehouse in
England and Wales ?&nbsp; This faith was allowed to keep its own marriage
registers when the change of law came into effect on 1st July 1837.&nbsp; I was
interested to learn that Jewish weddings were registered by the secretary of
the groom s congregation, regardless of where the marriage took place.
Presumably, the secretary would report the marriage to the civil registrar for
the district of that congregation, thus in some cases giving a false impression
of the place of marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More difficulties in  Family Search </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regular readers might recall that in the last newsletter, I
recounted how some marriages that came up in  Family Search  were not findable
in the parish register, because they were publications of banns that were never
converted into marriages.&nbsp; Another example turned up this quarter, when
Catherine Whitehouse and William Lee had their banns read for the third time on
7th October 1832 at the parish church of Madeley in Shropshire, but never
married there.&nbsp; If they did marry, it can only have been somewhere else
that has so far eluded me (and  Family Search ).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another mystery presented itself in the little Warwickshire
village of Bickenhill, where Ann Whitehouse and Robert Wagstaff s marriage was
indexed by  Family Search  as taking place there on 10th April 1754.&nbsp;
However, there was no such marriage entered among those for 1754 or either
adjacent year and there was no surviving banns book for that year.&nbsp; Yet,
according to  Family Search , the marriage was to be found on the film of the
parish registers of Bickenhill.&nbsp; Perhaps a page had come loose and was
filmed out of order at the end of the marriages ?&nbsp; No. Fortunately, a
flash of inspiration arrived.&nbsp; Turning to marriages in April 1764, ten
years on, there was the missing marriage.&nbsp; The clergyman had written
 fiftyfour  instead of  sixtyfour  in this one entry (amid all the correctly
written ones) and  Family Search  had failed to recognise this obvious error.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Misfortune of war</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Unfortunately for me, I regret to say, that whilst
directing the pointing of an 8-inch gun to where I believed some of these
riflemen to be...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...the gun, from some unaccountable cause, went
off and, in recoiling, the whole weight of both gun and carriage came down on
my left foot, injuring it very severely and breaking several bones, which I
fear will lay me up for some time. &nbsp; (Naval report from the Crimean War,
extracted from the London Gazette, Issue 21817, dated 20 November 1855)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>One up, one down ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>William Whitehouse, a potter s labourer, must have scratched
his head when filling in the 1911 census schedule.&nbsp; When asked the number
of rooms, he entered  In an old tramcar .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A happy New Year to all readers and I hope that yours has
got off to a better start than mine.  I could hardly believe my bad luck when
once again I was hit by a computer glitch when I was preparing the website
update.  For those interested in such matters, I encountered the  Blue Screen
of Death  and it hasn t yet gone away.  It will probably take a long time to
get back to normal.  Meanwhile, I am uploading the files to the website from
another computer - I hope !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly Report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most notable event of the quarter has been the near
completion of the digitisation process that has taken many years.  All the
files in my possession have now been referenced with the WFHC correspondent
number in the marriage, census and probate records on  my website - hurrah !  I
say  near completion  because one file has been researched and referenced, but
the tree needs to be re-processed and updated.  That s my own tree, which I
share with another correspondent, whose wife is my 5th cousin once removed.  I
shall be devoting a good deal of the first quarter of 2013 to this and to
improving a draft family history written some 12 years ago and not finished.  
Meanwhile, it will give me enormous satisfaction to throw away my old card
index running to seven shoe boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other significant achievements comprise:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a big advance in the 1911 census (England &amp; Wales)
transcript, in which I have added 2600 rows, thus making it about 84 percent
complete;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- an overhaul of the 1911 census transcript, mainly
improving consistency, dealing with missorted households and removing duplicate
entries;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a surprisingly substantial addition to the 1881 (England
&amp; Wales) census referencing file, of some 300 rows, which takes coverage to
about 49% of all Whitehouses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- further improvements to the 1837-1911 England &amp; Wales
marriage indexes*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Tipton parish church baptisms extended back to 1813 and
burials for 1813-1851 now transcribed**</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition of Ontario deaths, covering only those born in
England, but which have proved unexpectedly useful***</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>* thank you, Antoinette (WFHC 431) for the Derbyshire
marriage extractions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>** again, many thanks to you, Adrian (WFHC 141 &amp; 145)
for your valuable work which gave me so much help and encouragement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*** well done and thank you to Aaron (WFHC 311) for sending
images and a draft spreadsheet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter has brought 8 new correspondents, who have been
allocated 9 reference numbers.  The total stands at 546.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The 1881 census</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mentioned above that this referencing file, which now runs
to 4964 rows, represents about 49% of all Whitehouses.  For those who have not
followed the story, this file began in late 2006 and contains only those
Whitehouse households which have been referenced to a correspondent s tree.  It
has been built up slowly, alongside the digitisation project.  The latest
statistic is an indication of the extent to which I have captured Whitehouses
in England &amp; Wales and tethered them to a tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I normally use the Latter Day Saints  transcript and always
check it against the actual return.  The LDS transcript (also used by
 Ancestry ) is one of the very best - mistakes are rare and usually
unimportant.  However, I have just come upon a remarkable departure, where, in
the same household, an age clearly written as 64 has been rendered as 54 and 39
as 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Tips in searching the census</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If at first you don t succeed, try abbreviating Whitehouse
to Whit* where the asterisk is a wild card denoting any termination of the
word.  Admittedly you have to skip an awful lot of Whites, but it can be
worthwhile.  That s how recently I tracked down Joseph WHITEHOUSE and his wife
Ann in the Hill Top area of West Bromwich in 1881.  They had been indexed as
WHITELANE.  This wasn t another heinous mistranscription, for it did look more
like that than anything else, but on magnifying the image, one could see that
it could be WHITEHOUSE very badly written, which it had to be.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If that fails, try omitting the surname altogether and
scanning through the long list.  I did this for the 1901 census and to my
astonishment found that the WHITEHOUSE family sought had been enumerated as
SAUNDERS.  I pored over the entry for several minutes, trying to convince
myself that I must be wrong, but everything else fitted so well, there could be
no room for doubt.  Had the man changed his name to evade creditors, perhaps ? 
Ten years on, they were living elsewhere and were once again WHITEHOUSEs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>In with royalty</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most interesting entries in 1881 must be for the
ship HMS Penelope; Harwich (RG11/1782 FO 77 p26), where the crew list was
headed by HRH Rear Admiral The Duke of Edinburgh, aged 36, born Windsor Castle
and included Alfred WHITEHOUSE as a Secretary.  The Duke of Edinburgh here was
also an Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and
therefore second in line to the throne after the Prince of Wales.  After a
distinguished naval career in which he ended up as Admiral of the Fleet, the
highest rank, he died in 1900 at the age of 55.  Alfred WHITEHOUSE rose to
become Paymaster-in-Chief  in the Royal Navy, from apparently humble origins. 
This whole family (WFHC 562) contains other naval officers and notables, which
I shall show in a Sample Tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More problems with  Family Search </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You find a marriage in  Family Search , but when you look it
up in the parish register, it isn t there.  Your first thought is that maybe
you copied the date wrongly, your second that  Family Search  has indexed it
with the wrong date, but on searching nearby dates you still can t find it. 
Maybe it has been indexed in the wrong parish ?  So you check the Latter  Day
Saints  film number.  That seems OK.  The answer ?  The couple published the
banns, but never got married - well, not findably anyway.  Regrettably,  Family
Search  indexes banns as if they were marriages.  So, for example, the marriage
between Sarah WHITEHOUSE and Thomas ATHAWAY (presumably a phonetic rendering)
on 5th March 1820 at Warwick St Nicholas never took place.   Similarly, Jacob
WHITEHOUSE never married Mary TITMUS on 20th March 1791 at Sheldon St Giles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another difficulty is misindexing and misrecording.   Here
are some recent statistics relating to marriages within the period 25th March
1754 to 30th June 1837:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHIGHTHOUSE.  Just the one  hit  in FS from this highly
unusual spelling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHILEHOUSE.   No  hits  in FS - that s good, because the
name has no credible existence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHITCHOUSE.  This name doesn t exist, but Family Search
shows 9 marriages, which would be picked up by searching WHIT*HOUSE, where the
asterisk is a wild card indicating no or any character(s).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHITEHORSE.  One might think that this was a fairly frequent
name, so maybe it is surprising to find only 3 results for it.  Whether they
are misindexings or misrecordings remains to be determined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHITEHOUS.  There were 9  hits , but, of course, this
problem is easily avoided by searching WHITEHOUS* </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHITHOUSE.   FS gave 21 answers, of which 9 were in the
1800s.  Again, a search of  WHIT*HOUSE would show these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHYTEHOUSE.  This is a rare deviant spelling, but FS did
produce one entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WIGHTHOUSE.   Another rare deviant, this time yielding 2
entries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WITEHOUSE.  This  phonetic   rendering gave two  hits .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHITHOUS, WHITCHOUS, WHITTHOUSE, WITEHOUS and WITTHAUS were
all negatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The grand total is 48, of which two thirds occur in the West
Midlands (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire) and Shropshire.  The
West Midlands ones are included in my newly created database for marriages in
the stated time range.  There are just two in Shropshire:   John WHITCHOUSE to
Sarah WELLINGS 28 Oct 1816 Bridgnorth St Mary Magd and William WHITHOUSE to
Mary ALLMONDS 02 Feb 1807 Wombridge St Mary &amp; St Leon.   These will be
included when I extend the West Midlands database to cover Shropshire.  That
leaves 16 others which I have listed in a small file that can be consulted via
a link in BMD EXPLANATIONS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The cholera epidemic of 1832</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the register of burials at Sedgley All Saints for 1832
there is an extensive note, probably written by the Vicar.  He records that the
outbreak struck Bilston and Tipton in July and Sedgley in August, killing 290
people in Sedgley parish.  Under the leadership of the Vicar, Charles
Girdlestone, a Board of Health was set up, which raised  1031 to provide food,
clothing and nurses and to help widows and orphans.  Money was also raised to
distribute testaments, prayer books and religious books to the poor, including
a grant from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.  The note mentions
that there had been  a state of religious inquiry excited in the minds of the
people .  In other words, they must have been complaining that there could not
be a God who brought this plague upon them.  I have transcribed the whole note,
which can be found at <a href="The%201832%20cholera%20epidemic.doc">The1832
cholera epidemic</a>  .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>....and so say all of us</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At various times after 1812 and before 30th June 1837, some
marriage registers exhibit  blitzes  on obtaining consent.  Some edict must
have issued from bishops.  Consent of a parent to a marriage was required only
when one of the parties was a minor, that is to say under 21.  However, there
are entries in which widows and widowers are shown as having obtained consent
of parents, when these people are obviously of full age.  The officials at
Hampton-in-Arden parish church took this zealousness to extremes when in 1825
Mary Whitehouse married John Corfe with consent of friends.  In 1826 entries,
couples are shown marrying with the consent of the parish or the hamlet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 2nd October
2012</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major news this quarter is the creation of a Whitehouse
marriage details file for 1754 to1837 in the West Midlands.  The previous files
for individual parishes have been amalgamated and new ones added, resulting in
extensive coverage of the Birmingham area including the  Black Country , South
Staffordshire and much of Worcestershire.  It contains over 2500 entries.  This
indexed transcript will be of enormous benefit, not only because it includes
witnesses, marital condition etc., but because it corrects errors and rectifies
omissions in the Latter Day Saints  IGI and  Family Search  databases.  It is a
work in progress, as I have yet to complete some entries in rural
Worcestershire and I have discovered that the details of marriages in Dudley
from 1754 to 1780, which I thought I had covered, are still outstanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The new  Family Search  has so far been a disaster:  there
are large numbers of marriages missing, some dates are wrong, some
transcriptions are not the best and sometimes the parish is wrong.  Of course,
the old IGI was far from perfect, but its replacement is dreadful at the
moment.   For example,  Family Search  identified 10 of the missing Whitehouse
marriages in Dudley, but when I searched the 1978 edition of the IGI for
Worcestershire, I found another 9.  I intend to trawl the register in case
there are any more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I advise readers not to rely on  Family Search  for
Whitehouse marriages in the West Midlands.  The database provided here is more
accurate, more comprehensive and far more complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the way, if anyone would care to provide some help at the
Worcestershire and Staffordshire record offices, I would like to cover more
churches in these counties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because this marriages database has involved a lot of work
and because of extensive time spent in improving existing trees in my
collection, progress on the 1911 census and the 1880 US census transcription
projects has been very limited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1837 to 1911 marriage details file has made also only a
little further progress, but I have been helped by my third cousin Thelma
Felstead (who has no connection with Whitehouses) and by fellow-members of the
Guild of One-name Studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have to apologise for some errors in the Tipton baptisms
schedule for 1837 to 1851 launched mid-way through this last quarter and thank
Adrian Loker (WFHC 141 &amp; 145) for his own spreadsheet, thoughtfully
following my style, which I compared with mine.  He also extracted marriages
for 1813-37, not knowing that I was also working on Tipton marriages and it was
very helpful to be able to compare the results.  I intend later to work on
1813-1836 baptisms and 1813-1851 burials at Tipton and Adrian s work will be
very helpful.  For years, I have been using a paper schedule kindly provided by
Paul Whitehouse (WFHC 287 &amp; 347), which will provide a further check, but
it will be tremendous to get the baptisms on line so that they can be searched
more easily by name and occupation of father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been a big struggle to progress the project RADAP (<u>R</u>e-indexing,
<u>A</u>rchiving, <u>D</u>igitisation  <u>a</u>nd <u>P</u>aper-Destruction) by
which I am computerising all my paper files containing family trees or data
with which to make them.  I have managed (just) to convert another 6 of them,
so there are only 10 left.  There were again just two new correspondents this
last quarter, who were allotted the numbers 536 and 537, the latter being the
current total number of registered correspondents.  Both the new people were
connected to existing trees, which is now the norm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I often wonder whether people use my census transcripts, a
reflection brought to mind recently when I added to my 1851 census file two
Whitehouse families which had been misenumerated as Whitehurst and Whitehorn. 
The names were perfectly clearly written and the only way of knowing that they
were really Whitehouses was by working on the tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Darlaston All Saints</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a  problem about marriages here from 1872, when the
church was consecrated, to 1911.&nbsp; Its early marriage registers have been
destroyed by a bomb in world war 2.&nbsp; Last year I tried to persuade the
Walsall Registrar (Mrs. Lorraine Cotton) to copy her duplicate register,
without success.  She claims that it is beyond her legal powers to do so.  I
then requested personal access under Section 63 of the Marriage Act 1949: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

lang=EN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:white;
display:none'>E+W</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;background:white'><span lang=EN
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>(1)Every
incumbent, registering officer of the Society of Friends, secretary of a
synagogue and registrar by whom a marriage register book is kept shall at all
reasonable hours allow searches to be made in any marriage register book in his
keeping, and shall give a copy certified under his hand of any entry in such a
book, on payment of the following fee, that is to say..... </span><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She denied this to me, saying that her only power was to
issue a certificate upon payment of the fee, under Section 64 of the Marriage
Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her position is that she has no legal power to grant access in
any other way, because the register is in her custody as a Superintendent
Registrar, to which Section 64 relates.&nbsp; She and her Legal
Department&nbsp;deny that&nbsp;a Superintendent Registrar is a mere species of
the more general term Registrar used in Section 63, a denial which goes against
rules of legal construction.&nbsp; While I would dearly love to issue
proceedings against her for Breach of Statutory Duty under Section 63, which I
did threaten to do, there are certain potential problems in the legal process
which make the exercise not worth it, when my objective would be to obtain the
details of  9 or 10 Whitehouse marriages for the public benefit (not for my own
family history).&nbsp; Further, there are three registers involved and taking
such action would not help members of the public interested in the other 1490
or so marriages.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was allowed access to the Walsall Register Office's index,
which turned out to be in the form of notebooks giving only the page number of
the register as the reference, and so (as it chanced)&nbsp;not even enabling me
to assemble correct pairs of brides and grooms on each page, there being two
marriages to the page.&nbsp; The index did enable me to confirm positively that
All Saints is sandwiched between Darlaston St&nbsp;Lawrence (ancient parish
church)&nbsp;and St&nbsp;George in the church order for Walsall Registration
District used by the GRO clerks, with the result that anyone prepared to go to
considerable trouble can work out whether a marriage took place at All Saints. 
See my  Marriage Mining  paper for an explanation of how this works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I regard Lorraine Cotton and Walsall Council s refusal to
copy the register as sadly mistaken, not least since this is the only original
version of the Darlaston All Saints marriage register in existence:  the happy
couple signed two registers at the church, the one that is destroyed and the
other now in the hands of Lorraine Cotton.  The General Register Office s
version is a mere copy.  Wolverhampton Registrars have taken a different
position and deposited copy registers (Bilston St Luke and Wolverhampton St
George, the latter at my instigation) at archive offices.  If the legal position
on copying an old register were clear-cut, it would be another matter: no one
could criticise the Walsall Registrar for following the law.  However, it is
very far from that.  Indeed, Section 60 (1) (a) of the Marriage Act requires
the church s original register to remain in the hands of the incumbent. 
Furthermore, it has been admitted to me that the Walsall Register Office gets
very few requests for certificates for marriages of such antiquity, so it seems
unlikely that loss of fee income could accrue - hardly surprising when most
people would opt for getting the copy certificate online from the GRO in
Southport, which costs less.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A tale of the unexpected</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> The entry for my grandmother Edith Ellen Ballantyne Perry,
is incorrect.  It took 15 years for me to find out the truth about Edith.  My
grandmother (who married Walter Henry Sawyer Fisher) was in fact Edith Alice
Ballantyne.  It does say Edith&nbsp;Ellen&nbsp;on her marriage and death
certificates, but falsely. &nbsp;She was the real daughter of Kate and John
Ballantyne, 8th October 1881 in Portsmouth, Hampshire.  Her mother, Kate
Ballantyne (n e Carter), left her family in Portsmouth and&nbsp;went to
Uckfield in Sussex, where she married the Uckfield policeman, Robert John
Baldwin, bigamously, on 26th August 1884.  The marriage certificate described
her as a widow, when she was not.  John Ballantyne lived many years after and
died in the Royal Hospital Chelsea.  Meanwhile my grandmother Edith was brought
up by Ellen and Alfred Perry in the Christchurch, Hampshire, area.  They
changed her middle name from Alice to Ellen.  Kate also left another child,
Mercie Janette Ballantyne, who was brought up by her grandfather in
Lymington.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did track down Kate to Canada, whither she had
emigrated with her husband John Baldwin in the early 1900s. They had&nbsp;
another two children between them.  It s an amazing story of deceit.  I don t
know whether her policeman husband ever knew he had married someone who was
already married and had a family !   (From WFHC correspondent 197).&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Elisha Whitehouse diaries</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mentioned these 1819 and 1825 diaries of Elisha
Whitehouse, a prosperous Sedgley farmer, in the newsletter of 30th June 2009. 
The story has moved on since correspondent 488 has very kindly sent me a disk
containing scans of the diaries, which has enabled me to make a genealogical
extract.  There is a poignant entry on 22nd October 1825, shortly after
Elisha s only surviving child, Ann, married a Dr. Waterhouse:  My Wife took my
daughter Ann Waterhouse  100.0.0 and she says I have not done a Father s part
to her after laying out upwards of  500.0.0 in her education her has had
 50.0.0 worth of goods out of the house her left me and got married 15 days
above 19 years of age .  Another entry in the diary enabled me to work out that
I had wrongly joined Elisha s tree to another one, so I had to disconnect it. 
It also made me realise that if I had been a bit more diligent, I would have
come to this conclusion without the aid of the diary, but, alas, shortage of
time is a continual problem for me with these Whitehouse trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Hexham parish register mystery</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was troubled when a fellow researcher consulted me about a
register of baptisms in 1734 which contained the word  lest  followed by what
seemed to be witnesses, perhaps godparents, as in  Margery daughter of Mrs
Bowlton lest Mr Herbert Johnson, Mrs Carr &amp;c  .  I sent an enquiry to the
Tom Wood column in the magazine  Family Tree , following which many readers
said that it was  test , short for  testator  or similar, the Latin for witness. 
Incidentally, Parish registers were supposed to be written in English from 1733
onwards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 1st July
2012</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I began the April newsletter on a glorious afternoon when
our plum trees were all in blossom.  It had been a dry March and I pleaded for
rain.  Well, we have had a huge amount of rain since then and very few plums. 
Today, the residents association held a hog roast.  Happily, the animal was
well cooked before it rained again, but we stoical British put up our golfing
umbrellas and gazebos, uncorked our wine and tucked into roast pork burgers. 
It was such a good and long lunch that I did not progress this website update
as fast as I should have done.  So here I am, starting this newsletter at 9.20
p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been a third busy quarter in a row.  Another big push
at the 1911 census transcription project has seen estimated coverage of
Whitehouse-containing households advance from 53 to 68 percent, including a few
more counties and the addition of Dudley, Droitwich, Kidderminster and
Worcester City Registration Districts.  Many thanks to Jayne Sandles (441) for
her help with the last-mentioned item.  Although Dudley is in Worcestershire,
its Registration District is officially considered to be in Staffordshire.
Crazy ?  Not really, because it covers Tipton, Sedgley and Rowley Regis, all of
which are Staffordshire towns whose combined population by far outnumbers that
of Dudley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1880 US census transcription work has advanced modestly,
to cover the additional states of Arkansas, California and Kansas.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every quarter the GRO (England &amp; Wales) marriage index
for 1 July 1837 to the end of 1911 improves.  This last quarter many more
Whitehouse marriages have been referenced with the correct husband or wife in
the GRO M 1837-1911....  and very good contributions from Christopher
Whitehouse (100) and Antoinette Betteridge (431) have improved the M
Details.... file in Barrow-in-Furness and Derbyshire, respectively.  I am
always grateful to correspondents who respond to my requests for scans of
certificates of marriages which are not in this file.  You can tell which they
are, because they have no letter  f  (stands for  full details ) against them
in the GRO M 1837-1911.... file.  Those that take place in non-Anglican
churches and Register Offices are especially welcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christopher s work included the marriage of a Whitehouse
which appeared in the GRO index as Whitebourn, so that has been added to the
list as  New 5 .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, parish records have been another feature of the
quarter, with Whitehouse marriages in the 1754-1837 period at Birmingham St
Philip, Edgbaston, Harborne, Sedgley and Wednesbury added.  Coverage at Dudley
and Kingswinford has been taken back to 1754.  Why 1754 ?  On 25th March the
Hardwicke Marriage Act came into force, with the object of preventing
clandestine marriages and as a result parish marriage registers were vastly
improved. By the way, marriages in 1754 which took place before then are not
covered by these 1754-1837 files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strenuous efforts have been made to advance project RADAP,
by which I am computerising Whitehouse trees in my paper files, improving,
referencing and archiving them.  I dealt with the files of 13 correspondents in
the quarter, one, from someone now untraceable, was scrapped for containing
insufficient information and so the total outstanding is now down to 16. 
Progress would have been greater, but for time spent on improving existing
computerised trees and the exceptional number of male children encountered. 
There were just two new correspondents this quarter, who were allotted the
numbers 256 and 535, the latter being the current total number of registered
correspondents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A refusal and more bigamy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> This lady is a suffragette and refuses to give me any
information  (written against Evelyn Audrie Thomas in the 1911 census of 62
Winchester Street, Sherwood, Nottingham, where she was a visitor).  Margaret
Emma Whitehouse, of the same household, had married James Somerville Paterson,
a commercial traveller in Engineering Specialities.  The marriage was almost
certainly bigamous on her part and her first husband, Erskine Leopold H.
Harrop, probably also committed bigamy when he re-married in 1909.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The wrong Cornelius</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I work to the standard of reasonable probability or
&quot;more probable than not&quot;, rather than &quot;beyond all reasonable
doubt&quot;.&nbsp; This is the standard applied in civil law suits.&nbsp; The
reason that I have adopted it is that basically I am indexer and it is better
to index an event and risk getting it wrong than not to index it at all.&nbsp;
I construct trees to try to achieve full and correct indexing.   An interesting
situation was presented by the tree of the Kentucky Whitehouses (137, 394 &amp;
many others).  It is reasonably probable that the James Whitehouse who was a
pioneer settler in Kentucky in the 1780s was the son of a Cornelius Whitehouse
who married Ann Austin in London.  There is evidence to suggest that James was
involved in a  mugging  in London and sentenced to be transported to America in
1774.  The marriage of Cornelius to Ann Austin took place in 1758 at St Luke s
church in Old Street (Finsbury, London), when Ann was only 16.  Some
researchers in the United States have assumed that this Cornelius is the one
born in Birmingham in 1741, presumably because they considered it a rare
forename.  I have always felt that this was unlikely, as he would be only 16 at
marriage and thus rather young to support a wife and because Cornelius is not a
name of great rarity  - Dutch settlers of that name had been in England for
hundreds of years before then.  So, I declined to incorporate him in my tree,
as the idea failed my  reasonable probability  test.  Triggered by an e-mail
from Jim Whitehouse (394), I investigated the Cornelius Whitehouses in
Birmingham and concluded that they are of no proven relevance to the tree of
James Whitehouse and in particular that the Cornelius Whitehouse born in 1741
cannot be the one who married Ann Austin.  It was the will of Cornelius  sister
that proved decisive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Second name searching</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I try to incorporate some useful general tips in these
newsletters.  Here s one that I used recently when working on Tree 257.  The
1901 census showed an Arthur Whitehouse born in Smethwick, aged 4, yet there
seemed to be no birth registration for him.  A feature of the WFHC GRO Births
Index is that one can search under a second forename.  This because the first
and second forenames are listed in separate columns.  All I had to do was to
save a copy of the Index and sort by second forename and then by OO (original
order).  This revealed the birth of James Arthur Whitehouse in the first
quarter of 1897 in the correct Registration District for Smethwick (which is
Kings Norton).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A visit to the British Library</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As many will know, I have a general rule of not pursuing
female lines when working a tree forwards, that is to say towards more modern
times.  However, from time to time, I make exceptions in order to clarify how a
correspondent is descended.  I wanted to work on one such line which led to a
Mr. E.A.Corbett, a correspondent believed now deceased.  All I had to go on was
the E.A. initials and an address in 1984.  I did not know his age or his
parentage.  I decided to search the electoral register.  Firstly, I worked out
in which parliamentary constituency he was living at the time.  Constituency
boundaries change, so accuracy in this respect was essential.  Off I went to
the BL s handsome building in Euston Road, armed with evidence of identity. 
That proved essential to renew my time-expired reader s ticket.  From the
Humanities Department I ordered up two years of registers, which would take an
hour to arrive.  They will hold them for up to 3 days.  I went away to do
something else, returned later in the day and was easily able to find the man. 
What illumination this brought, for the initial  E  stood for Edison !  Problem
solved.  I linked him happily to Richard Corbett who had married twice, had 6
children by his first wife and 11 more by his second, Louisa Whitehouse. That
makes 17 in all, astonishing, even for the mid-1800s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Virtuous reward</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While transcribing Whitehouse marriages at Edgbaston, I
noticed when turning a page that  my  William Whitehouse and his wife Jane,
whose maiden name was Spencer, were witnesses to the marriage of a Mary Spencer
who must have been Jane's sister.&nbsp; The interesting thing is that without
embarking on this transcription work for the public benefit, it is most
unlikely that I would have come upon this marriage by any simple means. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Parish Register kept in a bank vault</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My transcript of Whitehouse marriages at Wolverhampton St
Peter lacks full details of three marriages in 1756 and February 1757.&nbsp;
They are not contained in the film made by the Latter Day Saints, which starts
in March 1754 and ends in May 1757, there being a large gap between some date
in 1754 or 1755 and May 1757.  There are no Bishop's Transcripts.&nbsp; The Staffordshire
Parish Register Society has made a transcript, but it does not include names of
witnesses or show whether the parties signed or made a mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Wolverhampton Archives' online index also lacks these details.&nbsp; Enquiry at
the Staffordshire Record Office revealed an amazing story:  the Register had
never been filmed and had been kept in a bank vault because it contained the
signature of one of the parties to the US Declaration of Independence, making
it valuable.&nbsp; This state of affairs seemed to me lamentable, because it
would be amazing if the bank were complying with the requirements of Schedule 2
of the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978 relating to the permissible
temperature and humidity of the safe or muniment room in which the registers
are kept and the requirement to record readings at least once a week.&nbsp;
Using my enquiry to show public demand, the head of the Staffordshire Record
Office has been able successfully to arrange the deposit of this register with
them.  They are going to film it when resources permit and meanwhile have very
kindly said that they will transcribe the missing details of the marriages for
me - a wonderful result.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 2nd April
2012</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It s a glorious afternoon here, 12  miles south of London,
with the sun shining and our three plum trees all in blossom at the same time,
which is most unusual.  We have a Rivers Early Prolific, an unidentified plum,
rather like a Tsar, which came with the house and crops incredibly heavily and
a Victoria.  You seldom see  Early Rivers  in the shops, probably because the
fruit is smaller than most plums and not sweet enough to eat raw unless really
ripe, but it has a wonderful flavour when stewed or made into jam.  Actually,
we need rain, fairly desperately and I need to get on with this newsletter...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This last quarter has been just as busy as the one before. 
The big effort on computerising trees last autumn has had a knock-on effect, as
I have been busy making amendments to them in the light of further
information.  However, my main activity has been to improve trees and records
that involve the Cannock area.  The villages of Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley,
both near Cannock, probably had the highest density of Whitehouses anywhere in
the world in the mid 1800s.  My own surname frequency study found the name to
be as  common  there as Smith and Jones are in the whole of England and Wales. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to trees, I am especially grateful to David F. Whitehouse
(WFHC 149), another assiduous researcher, who enabled me to connect his tree
via various female lines to several others.  As to records, I have extended the
1891 census transcript to cover Cannock town, Brewood, Bushbury, Coven Heath
and Lapley.  It has thus grown by 50 percent.  I have also improved the
referencing with WFHC correspondent numbers.  The 1911 transcript covers the
whole of Cannock Registration District (over 530 Whitehouses).  Parish records
coverage includes Cannock marriages and burials.  The burials records include
those from churches and cemeteries.  I thank Sue Challenger (WFHC 229) for her
contributions of cemetery records, which she extracted from work done by Pat
Everiss and Carol Adshead.  Other significant contributions have come from
David F. Whitehouse, mentioned above, and from Jake Whitehouse (WFHC 003).  I
also thank Sue and David for pointing out errors in my draft schedule. 
Additionally, I have transcribed Whitehouses in the early Methodist baptism
registers of Cheslyn Hay, finding several errors in other sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turning to the wider picture, I made a big late assault on
the 1911 census (England &amp; Wales) transcription project, which has grown by
a third, reaching about 53% of theoretical full coverage.  Here I was helped,
once again, by Jayne Sandles (WFHC 441), who completed the North and East
Ridings of Yorkshire, so very many thanks to her.  Such contributions are worth
more than their face value, because of the encouragement they give me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parish records have been another feature of the quarter,
with Whitehouse marriages at Rowley Regis, Walsall and Wolverhampton from 1754
to 1837 being put on spreadsheet. Existing transcripts, such as those made by
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and  the Birmingham &amp;
Midland Society for Genealogy &amp; Heraldry (BMSGH), are wonderful as indexes,
but lack witnesses. Occasionally, the witnesses at a marriage give vital clues,
which is where my transcripts can bring added value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this juncture, I must thank Steve Whitehouse (WFHC 240),
who has given the data processing people at the LDS in Salt Lake City a nudge
about the delay in putting Aston parish marriages into the new Family Search,
while at the same time withdrawing of the facility to search by batch number in
the old Family Search.  They are now searchable in the new version, so I am
hoping to work on Aston in the next quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Progress with computerising trees has been difficult this
quarter, but I have completed another 7 and the total outstanding is down to
30.  There have been 5 new registrations.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Fanny
Whitehouse, born 1866, married Gerard Collier in June 1889 at the Cannock
Registry Office.  Their eldest child, Fanny, born in 1890, became interested in
spirtualism at an early age.  The story goes that when she was 14, she was
attending a spiritualist meeting with her aunt, when the medium told her that
her mother, whom Fanny had seen only an hour previously, had just died.  Fanny
rushed home in tears, to discover that she had indeed.  This took place in the
Longton (Staffordshire Potteries) area, but there is no death registration that
fits these facts.  Fanny was one of a family of 8 children and as Gerard was a
coal miner, there would have been little money to spend on his wife s burial. 
Perhaps the death was never registered, although this would be unusual in the
20th century.  If so, one would expect Fanny the elder to have been buried at
Longton Cemetery, but no one has so far produced any evidence to show that she
died.  Certainly, she is with the family on the 1901 census and not with them
on the 1911 one.  In the absence of such evidence, I prefer a more earthly
explanation for these events, which I will leave to the imagination of readers.</span></p>

<p class=western style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> I've recently
purchased a very interesting book called 'A grim almanac of Lancashire' which
has a small story for each day of the year. Most of the stories are from the 19<sup>th</sup>

follows -</p>

<p class=western style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>13<sup>th</sup> June,
1895   At the Police Court at Leigh, 16 year old Charlotte Whitehouse of
Robertshaw Street, Leigh was charged and committed for trial for the
manslaughter of her 9 year old brother Thomas William.  Charlotte's mother and
sister stated that when Charlotte had come home on Friday, her mother had
beaten her with a sweeping brush, upon which the prisoner had kicked over a
paraffin lamp. This had exploded and burnt her brother so badly that he died
the following Saturday.</p>

says John White.&nbsp; Both of these documents are mere copies.&nbsp; The GRO
certificate is&nbsp;taken from a copy made by the church and sent to the GRO,
while the Bishop's Transcript is also made by the church, and sent to the Bishop.&nbsp;
There should be two original registers that the parties sign when in the
church, one of which, most regrettably, is still with the church (rather than
in an archive)&nbsp;and the other of which is with the Walsall
Registrar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man at Walsall St&nbsp;Matthew who made the
transcript for me [for a fee] is in Australia and will not be returning until
the middle of this month and even then, there is no guarantee that he will be
willing to inspect the register again, for no fee.   (From my e-mail to a

<p class=MsoNormal>It s 12.30 p.m. GMT on New Year s Day.  The updated and new

breakfast at 7 a.m.  However, I shall start the newsletter, always the nicest

challenging times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This last quarter I have made a huge effort on the RADAP
project, computerising the trees of 29 correspondents, making a total of 52 for
the year.  There remain just 35 trees, belonging to 38 correspondents, still in
the paper files.  [Correction, 2nd April 2012:  This should have read  37
trees, belonging to 40 correspondents.. ] Among the trees completed this
quarter is the massive one generated mainly by correspondent 100, but shared by
three others.  It runs to 23 pages and is the second biggest in my collection. 
Correspondent 100 (Christopher Whitehouse) is a most assiduous researcher, who
has extended his tree collaterally and who deserves particular thanks, because
of the extensive referencing of censuses and marriages that he has generated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Special Registration Day for Kentucky Whitehouses took
place on 9th October, as announced.  Four new correspondents (394 and 526-528)
were attached to tree 137 etc., making 14 in all.  It now runs to 74 pages. 
Another correspondent (529), with a separate tree, was also registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two researchers have been kind enough to thank me for the
Marriage Details file, which can be sorted by the names of the fathers.  I have
commented in the October newsletter on its coverage.  Since then, it has made a
modest advance and in this connection I thank correspondent 141, 145 for
extracting two marriages for me from the Gloucester Record Office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US 1880 Census referencing project has made further
progress, 8 states being added.  The state of Iowa has joined Indiana and
Kentucky in the 1870 file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A new record launched this quarter is the Dudley cemeteries
file covering burials from 1887 to 1960, which can be accessed via the BMD
EXPLANATIONS document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transcription of the 1911 census has made only slow progress
this last quarter.  I am a big fan of Findmypast, reckoning that their indexing
is a lot better than Ancestry s.  It is sad to report, therefore, that they do
commit transcription errors.  Two rather bad surname ones were found when
referencing the tree of correspondent 100, namely Whitechurch and Whitchner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the quarter I reviewed 10 years of progress since
10th October 2001, when I had to stop accepting new registrations, and wrote a
paper for the Journal of One-name Studies, which has been published in the
Jan-Mar 2012 issue.  I have provided a link on the index page of this website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keen readers of this website will notice that the  Lost
Contact  file has been removed.  It has been a big failure, having failed to
generate a single response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another change just made concerns Registration.  I am now in
so much better a position that I want to encourage more people to register with
the WFHC.  I have therefore done away with the Registration document, which
some might find off-putting.  It has been replaced by a short section in the Index
page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Help wanted</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I still hope to get some more help with the 1880 US census. 
It s pretty easy work and it s a shame that no one in the States has
volunteered their services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have a couple of other projects which would be very
suitable for doing at home or on a public computer terminal.  One is to extract
details of Whitehouses who entered the States via the Castle Garden Center
(1855-1890).  The other is to carry out a pilot study on extracting Whitehouse
information from The London Gazette, which contains fascinating information
about bankruptcies, amongst other things.  In both cases, the websites are free
to access.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A new Family search service</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am grateful to Steven Whitehouse (WFHC 240) for the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Thank you for all you have done to document and research
Whitehouse family history. I just wanted to let you know about this website as
it is fairly new and largely unknown to the public.<br>
<br>
You should know that there are actually two websites provided by the Church,
one is a revamped &quot;<a href="http://www.familysearch.org" target="_blank">www.familysearch.org</a>&quot;
which you are probably familiar with. The other one is named &quot;<a
href="http://new.familysearch.org" target="_blank">new.familysearch.org</a>&quot;
and is one that has not yet been publicized to the public in general. It has
only just recently been opened to the general public and is quite different
than <a href="http://www.familysearch.org" target="_blank">www.familysearch.org</a>.<br>
<br>
FamilySearch.org is largely a repository of general unlinked records with an
indexed search engine.&nbsp; <a href="http://New.familysearch.org"
target="_blank">New.familysearch.org</a> is a website that is a collaborative
tree where records are archived and linked together in a&nbsp; format that
allows users to share conclusions and to document artefacts.&nbsp; The
documentation tools are a work in process&nbsp;and will in the future allow
users to actually provide images of sources or links to internet providers of
artefact images .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The General Register Office (England &amp; Wales) indexes</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A recent press release advised that the following libraries
hold a complete set of GRO indexes including those for more recent events:<br>
Birmingham Central Library<br>
Bridgend (South Wales) Local and Family History Centre<br>
City of Westminster Archives Centre<br>
Manchester City Library<br>
Newcastle City Library <br>
Plymouth Central Library<br>
The British Library</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was interesting news, because the City of Westminster
has rather nice archive facilities, down a side street near the Houses of
Parliament, which is fairly easy for me to visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>It took them 35 years to marry</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While reviewing correspondent 100 s tree, I discovered that
a couple living together at the 1901 census did not marry until 1935.  Perhaps
they had to wait until the woman s husband died.  This must be a record for a
 late  marriage, unless someone out there knows better...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Genealogy tip comes unstuck</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of my tips for those who hit a brick wall is to search
for a second marriage of an ancestor whose first marriage preceded civil
registration.  The purpose of this is to find the name of the father.  I
applied my own tip to Thomas Whitehouse, a coal merchant in Tewkesbury,
Gloucestershire, who had married for the first time in 1834 and re-married. 
Unfortunately, he re-married twice and the marriage details gave different
fathers !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The bare-knuckle fighter and the famous Whitehouse</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone asked me not so long ago about a Whitehouse who was
a bare-knuckle fighter and I had to reply that I had never heard of such a
person.  Well, now I have, after computerising Tree 087 306 320.  He was Tom
Whitehouse, who took the middle forename Salmon, from his grandmother, Jane
Whitehouse, n e Salmon, and was one of a family of china and earthenware
dealers and fruiterers in the town of Warwick.  His daughter Beatrice married a
black man, by whom she had five children including the famous boxer Randolph
( Randy ) Turpin.  Randy enjoyed three months of fame in 1951 when he beat
Sugar Ray Robinson to take the world middleweight title.  After several
business failures, he shot himself and died at the age of 37 in 1966.  Randy
was legitimate, but my brief investigation showed that his elder brother, Dick,
himself a British &amp; Commonwealth middleweight champion boxer, was not.  He
was born out of wedlock by the 16-year old Beatrice as Lionel C T Whitehouse, a
matter on which the on-line biographies that I have read were silent.  So,
thanks to the practice of giving an illegitimate child the mother s surname, we
have another famous Whitehouse.  No doubt the 3rd initial  T  stands for Turpin
and  Dick  would be the obvious nickname, after the highwayman.  Beatrice was
only 17 when she married in 1921.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A mysterious change of name</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tree 087 306 320 has another interesting feature. Rhoda
Whitehouse (1855-1924) married Francis Barnes and they and their children are
well documented.  On the 1901 census the family, unquestionably the same,
appears under the surname Dawson.  Family lore has it that Francis was a
gambler and it is speculated that he changed their name to avoid being pursued
for gambling debts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Did he come down the chimney ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter s tailpiece has been contributed by Christopher
Whitehouse above-mentioned.   Francis Whitehouse, a chimney sweep, died in 1886
at Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, aged 62.  The cause of death, per coroner s
inquest, was entered on the death certificate as  Visitation of God .<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A bad start</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The current quarter has got off to a bad start, as I have a
serious computer malfunction, in which Windows froze and afterwards refused to
open Internet Explorer and several other programs.  The problem is not yet
resolved, so access to the web and to e-mails is difficult at the moment.  It
occurred during the preparation of files for the website updating and has
distracted me from it, which partly explains its lateness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quarterly report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last quarter I have been very busy, concentrating on
upgrading my indexes of Whitehouse marriages in England &amp; Wales for 1837 Q3
to 1911.  The basic index (GRO M 1837-1911 ....) contains 8913 lines of entry
and after 33 duplicates and deletions are removed, there are 8800 marriages.  I
am very pleased to report that the WFHC now has the full details of 6692, which
is 76 percent.  A further 14 marriages have partial details, including father s
name, date and place, while another 5 have a smaller amount of detail.  A big
problem over the years has been the lack of cross-referencing in the General
Register Office (GRO) index, so I am further delighted to say that the number
of Whitehouse marriages with the spouse s name added has reached 7920, which is
90 percent.  This total includes 1209 marriages with no detail, but with the
spouse s name and, among these, 149 also have an exact date.  All these
statistics count the 59 known Whitehouse-Whitehouse marriages twice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apart from the increases in numbers, I have made a major
change to the Marriage Details indexes, by combining those for the West
Midlands, London area and all other places into a single file.  The combined
file is called  M Details ...  and is massive, weighing in at 3.85 MB, 13926
lines of entry and printable to 262 pages of landscape A4.  A thorough
reconciliation of the GRO M 1837-1911 ... and M Details ... files has been
carried out, so that all marriages designated  f  (full details),  p  (partial
details that include the father s name, where given) and  s  (some extra
information, but less than the partial category) in GRO M 1837-1911 ... can be
found in the M Details file.  It is best to use the Universal Number (UN) to
locate the details.  I remind everyone that a big strength of the M Details
file is the ability to sort by the fathers  surnames and forenames.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am greatly indebted to <b>Ian Preece</b> (Guild of
One-Name Studies) for extracting some 75 or so Whitehouse marriages in
Stourbridge Registration District and I thank also <b>Christopher Whitehouse</b>
(WFHC 100) for contributing 20 certificates, some of which relate to marriages
in non-Anglican churches.  I particularly liked the  Reformed Episcopalian
Church of England  in Warrington, which was new to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The GRO (England &amp; Wales) births and deaths indexes have
undergone some  cosmetic  changes and, as the information contained in them is
the same, I have not re-dated them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is hardly surprising to report that less progress has
been made elsewhere with the records, but I thank <b>Jayne Sandles</b> (WFHC
441), yet again, for her work on the 1911 census of Essex, which has kept this
project going forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trees of 6 more correspondents have been computerised,
mostly after extensive work on my part to include collateral lines.  Three new
correspondents have been registered (WFHC references 282, 324, 376, these being
vacated old numbers).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Postal addresses</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From time to time, I have been asked why I want a postal
address in order to register someone.  Postal addresses continue to be an
important means for me&nbsp;of identifying people.&nbsp; E-mail addresses
change and few people think to tell me.&nbsp; In order to get in touch, I try
their telephone number.&nbsp; If that fails, I use the postal address to verify
the telephone number or lack of one.&nbsp; After that, I try  Google .  If all
that fails, I write to them at their last known postal address.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I
receive no reply, I enter them in the register as &quot;lost contact&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The provision of a postal address also means that the
correspondent is not &quot;anonymous&quot;.&nbsp; This is an important
safeguard which encourages the provision of accurate family information, since
there is a definite means of contacting him or her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There s also the issue of whether he or she can access
records easily.  Sometimes, I am able to help by finding particular entries in
parish registers using resources in London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Lost in translation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I was in the Family History Centre in August, a fellow
researcher was asking about some curious entries in the Hexham baptism register
of 1734.   The register appeared to give the names of godparents, preceded by
the word  lost  or  lest .  A Latin abbreviation ?  A local name for a surety
?  In the baptism service, the godparents stand as sureties for the child, but
the service contains no word  lest .  Suggestions welcome: here is a sample

<p class=MsoNormal><u>No sh*t !</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took me a long time to find the family of Edward
Whitehouse, a 54-year old iron-worker, on the 1891 census.  Ancestry had
indexed the surname as Shitcharce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 2nd July
2011</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u>Ever more thanks</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I remain deeply grateful to all
of you who make time to help me create these Whitehouse records.  By doing so,
you have put something back into the genealogical community, particularly in
the West Midlands, where the Whitehouse name is so frequent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Again, I must start with <b>Brian
Morris</b> (WFHC 518), who has contributed greatly to Cannock Registration
District marriages, bringing this part of the West Midlands Marriage Details
Project to completion.  His contribution has been immense.  Another thankee is <b>Jenny
Taylor</b> (WFHC 501) who visited Bushbury St Mary to extract a 1908 marriage
from a register which is kept at the church and has also filled in gaps in the
details of three other marriages.   <b>Mike Caladine</b> (WFHC 510) has kindly
sent me some CDs that he no longer requires and I shall be using these as the
basis for building some new databases of parish register extracts.  Another
contribution arrived in the form of an article from  Staffordshire Newsletter 
referring to the Jabez and Josiah James Whitehouse families of builders.  I am
grateful to <b>David Whitehouse </b>(WFHC 524), a descendant, for this.   <b>Dave
Whitehouse</b> (WFHC 512) has done a tremendous job in putting the 1880 census
of New Hampshire onto Excel:  New Hampshire is the second largest US state for
Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u>A classic exercise in
genealogy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>New correspondent 523 has been
connected to existing Tree 016 405, which is the Birmingham Cab Proprietors
tree.  Making the connection has been a  classic  exercise, involving the
following features:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(a) no baptism found for 523 s
ancestor, Elizabeth Whitehouse, yet her siblings were all baptised (in a
different parish)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(b) valuable clues obtained from
witnesses in the Handsworth St Mary marriage registers (transcribed and put on
this website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(c) comparison of signatures in
the original marriage registers (witness in one marriage and the party marrying
in another)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(d) one of 523 s children was
baptised in a Methodist chapel, which at that time (1835) recorded the names of
the mother s parents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(e) extensively repeated, less
common, forenames, Abraham, Cornelius and Ruth, in many branches of the large
tree, down the generations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(f)  first cousins marrying other
parties in two adjacently entered marriages on the same day and at the same
church</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(g) addresses given at baptisms
showing that the family moved from one parish to another</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(h) two married sisters having
their children baptised on the same day and at a different parish from the one
in which they lived</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(i)  two Whitehouses proved to be
brothers by Letters of  Administration taken out when one died</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The connection, a joint operation
between me and 523, had an important result for the original correspondents 016
and 405, as the Methodist baptism provided much stronger proof of their
ancestry than had been obtained previously.  It all adds up to this: firstly,
always pursue the collateral lines, that is to say the siblings of those in
your direct line, working backwards if possible, but forwards in time as well
and secondly, make sure that you keep your e-address up to date, as
correspondents 016 and 405 did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u>He married his first wife s
niece</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One aspect of  the tree of the Birmingham metal rollers (012
etc) relates to Thomas Whitehouse born in 1812 and his brother, James
Whitehouse, the pistol finisher born in 1814.  When I reached WFHC
correspondent 297 in the ongoing digitisation programme, a remarkable story
emerged.  Briefly, Thomas Whitehouse separated from his wife Ann, nee Abley, or
maybe she died, in the early 1850s, after the 1851 census.&nbsp; He took up
with Cecelia Ann&nbsp;Potter and they had or acquired two children (the first
might not have been his) and they sailed to Melbourne and on to Hobart in
1861.&nbsp; At some point, they returned to England and appear on the 1871
census, but emigrated to the US in 1873, where they appear on the 1880 US
census.&nbsp; They died shortly afterwards, but their son Arthur continued the
line.&nbsp; Cecelia Ann Potter was&nbsp; the daughter of Hannah Maria Abley,
the elder sister of the above-mentioned Ann Abley.&nbsp; In other words, Thomas
Whitehouse &quot;married&quot; his first wife's niece.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not all.&nbsp; Information from New Zealand via
correspondent 297 has revealed that a Catherine Whitehouse aged 2 on the 1841
census and 12 on the 1851 census, with her grandfather Thomas and uncle Thomas,
was James  daughter.&nbsp; She sailed with the Whitehouse and Potter families
in 1861.&nbsp; In about 1865, Albert Potter, a brother of Cecelia Ann Potter,
deserted his Tasmanian wife and took Catherine with him to New Zealand.&nbsp;
Albert had a controversial life in which he turned his hand to many trades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress report  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There have been some big leaps
forward in the records this quarter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Marriage Details project has
made further progress.  It is now complete for all Anglican churches in
Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, in the period 1st July
1837-1911, except for 6 marriages in Coventry and Foleshill, the Stourbridge RD
marriages being extracted by my Guild of One-name Studies colleague Ian Preece,
three marriages at Rocester (near Uttoxeter, North Staffs), 12 marriages at
Darlaston All Saints, for which the church registers have been destroyed and 4
marriages at Walsall St Matthew in 1838-39, where the only registers currently
available are Bishop s Transcripts in the old style.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The 1911 census transcription has
advanced  from 4174 to 6639 lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There was a glitch in the previous
1880 US census file, in which some entries for New York were duplicated or
triplicated, thus somewhat obscuring the effect of the addition of New
Hampshire, which, however, has given a huge boost to overall coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Three new correspondents have been
registered this quarter (WFHC 523 to 525) and the trees of 11 existing ones
digitised.  I have been tackling the remnants of my bundle of papers relating
to correspondents with only a peripheral interest in a Whitehouse.  Four were
removed from the register, because their connection  was too flimsy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u>The WFHC &amp; money</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Whitehouse Family History
Centre has always been a charitable type of venture.  My services have always
been given freely and there is no intention to make any charges.  Since the
WFHC has no income, it makes no profit:  indeed, it runs at a loss, since I
have had to make many trips from my home 12 miles south of London up to the
West Midlands and have spent on the occasional marriage certificate to plug a
hole in WFHC records.  My collection of  wills and administrations has been
another significant loss-making element, as many were obtained by post from the
various diocesan archives.  Minor expenditure is incurred when I lose track of
a correspondent because an e-mail bounces and I cannot find a  phone number  In
these circumstances, I send a letter asking him or her to get in touch with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u>Try transcribing this</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the 1911 census of Wigan
Registration District, there is an Elyben Whitehouse aged 3, born in Wigan.
 Elyben  is what it looks like and is the transcription made by FindMyPast. 
There is probably no such forename and certainly no birth registration in that
name.  The solution to this conundrum became evident only after sorting the
WFHC s GRO B 1837-1911 database by Registration District.  The top part of the
letter  b  in  Elyben  can be read as a flourish upstroke of the  y , 
whereupon  Elyben  looks more like  Elyven , an attempt at Evelyn, whose birth
is indeed registered in Wigan Registration District in 1908 !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 6th April
2011</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Still more thanks</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am so very grateful to those who volunteer some help. 
Just small amounts can save me heaps of time, which can then be devoted to
completing other records tasks.  Quite apart from the practical value, it
raises my morale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must start with <b>Brian Morris</b> (WFHC 518), who has
made a big contribution to Cannock Registration District marriages.  Also
contributing significantly to this project was <b>Jill Beckett</b> (WFHC 490),
who extracted 32 Cannock and Hednesford ones for me.  Cannock RD includes the
villages of Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley, where the name Whitehouse was, and
maybe still is, as frequent as Smith and Jones.  <b>Brian Morris</b> has also
been working on the Potteries RDs of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-upon-Trent and
Wolstanton Registration Districts.  His support for the marriage details
project has therefore been massive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last of the Anglican marriages missing from the
Wolverhampton file have been copied by <b>Sylvia Peers, </b>a fellow-member of
the<b> </b>Birmingham &amp; Midland Society for Genealogy &amp; Heraldry
(BMSGH).  <b>Joan Morganti</b> (WFHC 496), who has already provided great
assistance, has extracted the details of non-Anglican marriages in
Wolverhampton and, even more valuably, has visited Hatherton St Saviour
(Cannock RD) to extract marriages from a register held by the church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My progress with Walsall area marriages has been limited by
the non-availability in London of most of the registers of the old parish
church of St Matthew during the 1837Q3 to 1911 period, so I was very glad of
the help provided by <b>Laraine Preece</b> (WFHC 420).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rural Warwickshire has been problematic, because of the
large number of country churches, but I have been helped by several people
making small but highly valued contributions.  Thus, <b>Barbara Biddle</b>
(BMSGH), kindly went to the Leicestershire Record Office for me to check on
some of the marriages in Atherstone Registration District.  Atherstone is in
the east of Warwickshire close to the county boundary, so its RD covers parts
of Leicestershire.  <b>Jayne Sandles</b> (WFHC 441) helped with a marriage at
Polesworth.  In Stratford RD, I was rescued by the <b>Warwickshire Record
Office</b> who looked up a wedding that I managed to pinpoint to Wellesbourne. 
The problems in Nuneaton RD were a little more complicated, but I was fortunate
to get highly competent assistance from <b>Mark Thursfield</b>, who, like me,
is a member of the Guild of One-Name Studies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Worcestershire village of Inkberrow falls within
Alcester RD, a Warwickshire Registration District, and here I was helped by
another contribution from <b>Netta Hughes</b> (WFHC 172), who also tidied up
some  loose ends  in Droitwich RD and the City of Worcester.  The parish of
Quinton is a mere 5 miles from the centre of Birmingham, but, quirkily, formed
part of Stourbridge RD, having been split off from Halesowen parish.  Although
I had previously extracted the Whitehouse marriages there, checking of my
database revealed one more, so I was grateful to <b>David Fall</b>, another
member of the Guild of One-Name Studies for help with that at the Birmingham
Library.  I did some work for him in return.  Also, <b>Lindsey Crompton</b>
(WFHC 237) checked some details for me in the Birmingham Library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ian Preece</b> (Guild of One-Name Studies) has been
another tower of strength, extracting four marriages in rural Worcestershire,
suggesting where to find another one and helping in other ways.  <b>Sonja Smith</b>
(BMSGH) very kindly found a marriage at the village of Brimfield
(Herefordshire) in the Worcestershire Registration District of Tenbury and
helped with some other Herefordshire marriages as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jayne Sandles</b>, above, is also responsible for giving
the 1911 census programme a boost, when she transcribed Northamptonshire, so
many thanks to her.  She has just finished Leicestershire as well and that will
be added shortly.  <b>Sue Hendrie</b>, a new correspondent (WFHC 522), has
kindly helped with me a query on the 1911 census in relation to another tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last, but not least, comes <b>Dave Whitehouse</b> (WFHC 512),
who has transcribed Whitehouses from the 1880 US census of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I just hope that I have not left anyone out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During this quarter, I have welcomed three new
correspondents, WFHC 520 to 522, and have digitised the trees of 6 existing
correspondents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last quarter s newsletter announced an all-out attack on
marriage details.  Marriage details  means all the essential details that are
seen on a marriage certificate.  Progress has been truly staggering.  I have
been working on films in London and making several visits to the Stafford
Record Office.  On one of them, I met Brian Morris (above), who has made such a
big contribution.  Others have played useful parts, too.  The result of all
this activity is that I am cautiously optimistic of completing the marriage
details of all Whitehouses who married in Anglican churches in Warwickshire,
Worcestershire and Staffordshire and for which the church registers are in
existence.  There is still some way to go, but this target should be achievable
by the end of the year.  With this goal firmly in mind, I have amalgamated all
the marriage details files that are complete or nearly complete for all
Anglican churches in these counties and created a massive M Det W MIDS RDs
file, which currently weighs in at over 3MB and covers 5556 marriages in total,
including full details for over 4900.  It s been quite a problem with the
frequent name of Whitehouse that the databases are large.  As broadband usage
and computing power have grown, I have gradually combined databases so as to
create bigger ones that offer better searching possibilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last newsletter, I introduced a new noun into the
English language:  thankee - a person who is thanked.  This quarter, it s a new
verb: to deglitch.  The big M Det W MIDS RDs file needed a lot of deglitching. 
It was a bit worrying when I found that more men had married than women.  The
explanation was not polygamy, but a glitch in which I had entered two women as
men.  There were many others.  I don t suppose that I have removed them all, so
if you find something inconsistent or even downright wrong, please take the
trouble to let me know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Towards the end of last year I was frustrated in wanting to
extract 11 Whitehouse marriages at Wolverhampton at All Saints and St George. 
The All Saints marriage registers were not at the Staffordshire Record Office
and had been thought by the SRO to have been destroyed in a fire there in
1984.  Upon enquiry, I learned that the vicar had found the registers last
October, when a safe was forced open and was going to send them to the local
Registrar.  This was entirely the wrong place, as the Registrar already had one
set of the registers.  Anyhow, I persuaded the vicar to deposit them at the
SRO.  For St George, there was just the one missing register, covering
1865-1871, and here also I intervened, with the result that the Wolverhampton
Registrar made a copy, which has been placed in the Wolverhampton Archives. 
This had the excellent result that the Archives will be able to plug a hole in
their index of marriages up to 1875.  Wolverhampton is now complete for all
Anglican churches, but there remains a Roman Catholic marriage to be
extracted.  It has been really pleasing that the rather narrow pursuit of
Whitehouse genealogy has resulted in this broader benefit to those with
Wolverhampton ancestors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Work is in progress on the remaining 6 registration
districts - the Potteries ones, Stourbridge (where I am awaiting results from a
fellow member of the Guild of One-name Studies), Stafford and Walsall.  In
Walsall RD, I have encountered several major obstacles to progress.  The
biggest of them concerns Darlaston All Saints church, which was flattened in a
ww2 bombing raid, resulting in destruction of its registers.  I have asked the
Walsall Registrar to copy the ones that run from the consecration of the church
in the late 1800s up to 1911.  Initially I met with a refusal on legal grounds,
which is rather surprising, considering that the Wolverhampton Registrar copied
a register.  However, I hope that she will change her mind, as there are 13
Whitehouse marriages at this church to be either extracted or checked.  Another
impediment arose at Walsall St Matthew.  It looks as though this church did not
keep duplicate registers in its earliest years after civil registration began,
as only Bishop s Transcripts, written in the old style of marriage book, are
available.  This has resulted in my being unable to get full information for 4
Whitehouse marriages there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Walsall problems have set me onto looking at the 1949
Marriage Act, which is still the basic legislation under which the present
system of obtaining certificates from a local registrar or from the General
Register Office operates, but I think I ll defer sharing with you my ruminations
until later this year, as this newsletter is already running late.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Progress has been made on other fronts.  In particular, the
1911 census has advanced.   I have completed Warwickshire, which is the second
biggest county in terms of Whitehouse names, while Jayne Sandles has done
Northamptonshire and Leicestershire.  There are now 4174 lines of entry (up
from 3743 at the turn of the year).  If you have access to FindmyPast, please
contact me if you can help by doing (say) 100 Whitehouses, which usually
amounts to about 150 lines of entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Apprentices index, which can be accessed through the
MISC EXPLANATIONS file, has been re-worked and some entries added.  There are
over 120 Whitehouse entries, as apprentices and masters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indexing of Whitehouses in the 1880 US census has made
pleasing progress, with Massachusetts and New York State completed.  This work
has remained in the background, owing to priority being given to the England
&amp; Wales marriage details index, but it is hoped to keep it moving along
this year.  If you can type in an Excel spreadsheet and have access to the
Ancestry database, please offer to help.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>I got rid of a Whitehouse !</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was having trouble locating the church at which Ruth Ann
Whitehouse married in 1875 in Hereford Registration District.  The GRO had
indexed her marriage under both Whitehouse and Whitehorne.  Which was it ?  I
tried to discover the church, but my alphabetically-based  Marriage Mining 
method seemed to have let me down.  Sonja Smith (above-mentioned) and the
Hereford Record Office found it under Whitehorne and that it had taken place at
the village of Much Birch, a few miles south of the City of Hereford.   The GRO
clerks had fooled me by indexing it under the letter  B  for Birch, Much.  One
of the minor problems of the marriage details work has been country churches
that are still holding on to their register, which is probably the same one as
when the church was consecrated and so started to perform marriages.  Much
Birch was an example.  However, some digging in the censuses showed very
clearly that the name was originally Whitehorn.  So, Ruth Ann has been struck
off the marriages list and I did not have to find someone to visit the church,
thank goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A happy New Year to all readers of this website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More thanks</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I thought that I had just invented a new word -  thankees  =
people who are thanked.  I put it into  Google  and found that a few people are
using it instead of in the sense of  thankies , instead of   thanks .  My
biggest thankee this quarter and possibly for the last 5 years is <b>Adrian
Loker</b> (WFHC correspondent 141 and 145 - he has  two Whitehouse trees).   He
doesn t live in the West Midlands, but was kind enough to do two and a half
days work at the Stafford Record Office on Wolverhampton marriages.  I was so
buoyed up by this supremely kind and generous effort that I matched his time
there, with the result that the Wolverhampton Registration District Marriage
Details index is nearly complete, as far as it can be taken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smaller contributions can also make a big difference.  Thus,
<b>Antoinette Betteridge</b> (WFHC 431) visited the Derbyshire Record Office at
Matlock, to finish off the Burton-upon-Trent Marriage Details index for me. 
Burton is just in Staffordshire, but the Registration District covers places in
Derbyshire.  For foreign readers who have never visited Matlock, it is a small
town sitting in a valley by a river and surrounded in part by the rugged rock
cliffs of the Derbyshire hills - very scenic, as so many parts of England are. 
Good citizens of the USA, please come and spend your dollars here now that
exchange rates are so favourable, as our economy needs you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fay Summerfield</b> (WFHC 028), a very long-standing
correspondent, enabled me to finish the Bromsgrove RD Marriage Details index,
by visiting a church which has held on to its registers.  <b>Carol Ravenhall</b>
(WFHC 280) also helped me, with a look-up in Birmingham Library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Karen Burnell</b> (Guild of One-Name Studies) again
kindly stepped in when I had a problem in Solihull RD Marriage Details Index,
which is nearly finished as I write this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must also thank <b>Brian Morris</b> (WFHC 518) who has
made a start on Cannock marriages and the <b>Warwick Record Office staff</b>
who have kindly helped me with a couple of marriages that I could pin down to
specific churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During this quarter, I have welcomed two new correspondents,
WFHC 518 and 519, which brings the total for the year to 7, a manageable
number.  This compares with 39 in 2009 and 34 in 2008.  Ideally, I would like
to register about 12 new people a year.  On this subject, I revert to the
Kentucky Whitehouses (from James Whitehouse, the pioneer settler), for whom I
have a vast tree running to over 60 pages (WFHC 137 etc).  There are at least
two potential new correspondents here and I have decided to register them in
October 2011 and it would save my time if anyone else who wants to register in
this connection would contact me before then.  Adjusting the references for
this huge tree is no small task and this will probably be the last time that I
shall undertake such an operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reduced level of new registrations has enabled me to
make reasonable progress in putting onto computer more of my existing stock of
trees.  This quarter, I dealt with the trees of 11 previous correspondents,
making a total of 29 for the year (target = 25).  This means that there are
just under a hundred left to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the year, I re-assessed my priorities in relation to
creating new records and decided to launch an all-out attack on marriage
details.   Marriage details  means all the essential details that are seen on a
marriage certificate.  The main aim is to complete them for all Anglican
churches in a large part of the West Midlands, where the Whitehouses are most
concentrated, from Worcester in the south west, taking in the  Black Country 
and Birmingham, via Lichfield to Burton-upon-Trent in the north east, areas of
Warwickshire south and south-west of Birmingham (Kings Norton, Alcester Meriden
and Solihull), and extending north to Wolverhampton, Walsall and Cannock.  This
seemed a very distant hope at the beginning of 2010 and now looks achievable if
I can get a little help.  Cannock (including Penkridge, its predecessor) is
under way, but needs help.  Walsall is beginning in a small way and needs
help.  Just a few hours will be very, very, welcome.  Stourbridge is two thirds
complete, but help is at hand.   These three are the major works in progress. 
I have a promise of assistance with Alcester, Droitwich and Worcester, all of
which are near to completion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, I have made a database of Whitehouse marriage
details for a large area of greater London, which, although not finished for
all Anglican churches, is as near to complete as I can reasonably make it. 
That will be uploaded to the website very shortly, along with another database,
highly fragmented, for the rest of England &amp; Wales.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a consequence of all this activity, the main Whitehouse
GRO marriage index for 1 July 1837 to the end of 1911 has been altered to
include a symbol  f , signifying that full details of the marriage are
available from one of the Marriage Details files.  Use the Registration
District and the Universal Number (UN) to find them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Progress has been made on other fronts.  In particular, the
1911 census has advanced.  It has proceeded alphabetically to Dorset and
further inroads have been made into Warwickshire.  There are now 3,743 lines of
entry (people in households containing a Whitehouse) altogether, which compares
with 414 at the beginning of 2010.  This rate of work cannot be maintained, but
I shall be adding to it little by little.  Please contact me if you can help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New this quarter is an index of Apprentices, which can be
accessed through the MISC EXPLANATIONS file.  This is a work in progress, but
enough has been completed to make it worth launching it.  There are over 80
Whitehouse entries, as apprentices and masters.  It will be a pleasure to visit
The National Archives at Kew in order to add some of the missing detail.  The
tedious train journey there is compensated by the pleasant building and working
environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The 1911 census</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have probably read that  TheGenealogist  and  Ancestry 
are joining forces to produce a rival digitisation of the 1911 census to that
of   FindMyPast .  Given the immense cost involved, it seems unlikely that it
will become freely available in libraries.  It will be interesting to discover
whether they correct the indexing errors in FMP.  I have found a few, but on
the whole, the FMP index is of good quality.  Recently, I discovered what I
thought to be a curious glitch.  When I want to know the number of Whitehouses
in a specific county, I normally just select the county from the drop-down
menu.  However, there is another way, which is to type the name of the county
into the  Residential Place  box.  The latter sometimes gave a higher number ! 
For example, the answer is the same for Warwickshire (1540), but for
Staffordshire it is 4694 against 4637 and for Worcestershire 1060 versus 1044. 
So, I asked FMP about Staffordshire and got the following reply:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> When using the  Place of residence  field it draws matching
results from the following header fields:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>City/Municipal Borough; Ecclesiastical District; Parish;
Registration District; Municipal Ward; Town; Hamlet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A key word search in residential place should pick up
anything (including parish or reg district) from any of these seven fields.
When selecting Staffordshire from the drop down county list it only takes the
details from one part of the census return - this is why different results are
returned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, that makes sense, but on that basis I would have
expected a much greater difference between the two results.  I mentioned last
time that the FMP index is based on Registration Districts, but many of these
cover parts of more than one county.  Thus, Yardley in Worcestershire falls
within Solihull RD, but Solihull is in Warwickshire and therefore included in
that county s index.  Indeed, there is a big difference in Derbyshire, 196 from
the drop-down list, but 237 by typing in the name, which amounts to 21 percent
more.  The explanation must surely lie in boundary confusion, particularly with
Nottinghamshire at such places as Sandiacre and Stapleford.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> My ancestor disappeared in the mid- to late-1800s </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> According to an article in Family Tree Magazine, October
2010 (page 75), it has been estimated that between 1865 and 1871 more than
15,331 ships that left British ports were shipwrecked, many of which came to
grief in Australian and New Zealand waters.  Between 1850 and 1860, 571 ships
were wrecked off Australia.  The article focuses on the wrecking of ships of
the Loch Line, which lost half of its fleet of 24.  Such casualties hastened
the replacement of sail by steam.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 5th
October 2010</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Thank you very much</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A huge amount has been achieved this quarter and I m going
to start by thanking the very many people who have helped me.  I shall do this
by alphabetical order of surname:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Arthur Aston</b> (BMSGH Link Scheme) went to the Stafford
Record Office and kindly transcribed for me some marriages at Burton-upon-Trent
churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Karen Burnell</b> (Guild of One-Name Studies) very
helpfully sorted out a conundrum for me, when the register of Nechells St
Clement should have showed the marriage of William Henry Whitehouse to
Elizabeth Walton, but did not.  It was solved when she found the signature of
the couple underneath the particulars of a different marriage.  Evidently they
had signed a blank page of one of  the church s duplicate register books and
someone had later filled it in wrongly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kaye Christian</b> has no connection at all with
Whitehouses.  I approached her via a website and she was kind enough to send me
many transcripts from Burntwood, Chasetown and Ogley Hay which were used as the
foundation for constructing the Lichfield Registration District marriage
details database.  I did some jobs for her in London in exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Lindsey Crompton</b> (237) did some excellent  marriage
mining  in the Birmingham Library on Aston Registration District marriages. 
She did a lot of work finding Duddeston marriages, where it was difficult to
work out in which church to look first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Judy Earp</b> (474) went to Smethwick Archives, thereby
settling the last few queries in Kings Norton RD.  She inspected the original
register of Smethwick St Paul, the microfiche for which are really poorly
filmed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>David Fall</b> (Guild of One-Name Studies) investigated his
own database, relating to other surnames, to tip me off about the possible
anomalous position of Nechells St Clement in the church order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Netta Hughes</b> (172) helped with the Kidderminster RD
marriage details, which included getting sight of the original register of
Bewdley St Anne, because the microfilm was scratched across the middle, causing
part of the entry to be unreadable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Adrian Loker</b> (141, 145) checked the details of a
marriage at Cheltenham.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Pat Molloy</b> (409, 410) has been a tower of strength,
filling in gaps in my Lichfield and Tamworth RD marriage details files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Judith Parkins</b> (071), who many years ago did some
wonderful work in finding Whitehouses in the 1871 census for Wolverhampton,
visited Warwick Record Office and extracted 5 Whitehouse marriages from the
register of the country church of Kingsbury, within Tamworth Registration
District.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Carol Ravenhall</b> (280) followed up David Fall s
suggestion and found a missing marriage at Nechells St Clement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Lennox Smith</b> is a cousin of mine who lives near the
church of Boldmere St Michael in the Sutton Coldfield area.  That church has
not deposited its registers in an archive and he went to the church office and
extracted a marriage for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dave Whitehouse</b> (512) tackled the 1880 US census for
Connecticut and Ohio, while</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bob Whitelock</b> (457) transcribed Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you all so much, whether you did substantial chunks or
just oddments to help me finish a project.  You are stars.  I have now got to
the situation where I am simply asking people directly for their help.  I m
glad to say that most people are pleased to do a little to contribute and it
has been a revelation to me how many make light of their own physical
infirmities when doing so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Mining the marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major news this quarter again concerns the marriage
details indexes, which have been going splendidly, not least thanks to the
helpers.  To the major districts of Aston, Birmingham, Dudley, Kings Norton and
West Bromwich, have been added five smaller ones - Bromsgrove, Burton-on-Trent,
Kidderminster, Lichfield and Tamworth.  In the result an amazing 3874 marriages
have been extracted, over 40% of all the 1837 Q3 to 1911 Whitehouse marriages
in England &amp; Wales.  In addition, Worcester RD is nearly complete, more
than half of Stourbridge RD has been done and a start has been made on
Wolverhampton RD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volunteers are wanted to work with me on Wolverhampton and
to help me make a start on Walsall.  Cannock RD is relatively straightforward
and so anyone in that area who would like to make a contribution can make a big
contribution for a relatively small amount of effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nothing has been done on the London marriage details project
this quarter.  However, considerable progress has been made in sweeping up the
miscellaneous transcriptions from other parts of the country into another
marriage details file, not yet in a proper state to put on the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The 1911 census</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have put in a big effort here, increasing the coverage of
my transcript to about 20% of England &amp; Wales.  I have been proceeding in
two basic directions, the first alphabetically by county, where I have got as
far as finishing Derbyshire, the second in tackling the county indexed as
Warwickshire, which is over 75% complete.  Warwickshire is, of course, a big
county for Whitehouses and there are still 254 out of 1145 left to do.  One
thing that people might not realise is that in the Findmypast index, it is the
county of the Registration District that is indexed.  So, for example, Solihull
is a Warwickshire Registration District, but contains people who live in Acocks
Green and Yardley, which are in Worcestershire.  Conversely, it would be no
good looking under Warwickshire for someone living in 1911 in Edgbaston. 
That s because Edgbaston lies in Kings Norton Registration District, which
comes under Worcestershire.  Further work will very likely proceed at a slower
place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Surely, you must be exclaiming, you are infringing
Findmypast s copyright ?  Actually, no, because I am using a completely
different layout and there is no copyright in the information - only in the
 literary work  that results from it.  Mine is a completely original and
different literary work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Long live spreadsheets</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mentioned in the last newsletter how pleased I was to have
completed the tree of correspondent 003, at long last.  Well, as a young lad,
he remembered a cousin by the unusual name of Tertius Whitehouse.  He rather
admired Tertius, who he thought was born around 1917 and who joined the
Grenadier Guards in the 1930s.  So, I entered his name in the births section of
FreeBMD (without any limit as to the years) and found nothing.  After having
written to the regiment, he obtained quite a bit of detail about Tertius,
including a date of birth in 1910.  My GRO births spreadsheet goes up to 1911,
so I looked him up there and found a Tertins D Whitehouse.  It s only one
letter different, but when you enter the name in a box, you only get what you
enter, whereas a spreadsheet allows your eye to roam over many possibilities
that might not have occurred to you, including misindexing.  I should add that
the Findmypast index to the 1911 census renders the poor baby as a male with
the forenames Florence David !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More strange marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another bigamous marriage came to light in the last
quarter.  I can t immediately locate the tree involved, but will update this
item if it comes back to me.  [Postscript: Tree 194 453.  The bigamous marriage
was by a Thomas Willetts Whitehouse, an Iron Works Labourer, who married Mercy
Pardoe in 1866.  She was still alive when Thomas re-married in 1879 at the
Derby Registry Office, to Lydia Harlow.  Subsequently, he moved to Rotherham,
changed his surname to Willetts.  Yet, by 1907, when he married for the third
time, it was as Thomas Willetts Whitehouse. By then, both Mercy and Lydia had died].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, correspondent 360 asked whether it was correct
that two Whitehouse sisters in the Bahamas in the mid-1800s had married two
brothers who were stepsons.  That was my information gleaned from another
correspondent and it looked credible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> RADAP  &amp; New Registrations Report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trees of 6 correspondents have been digitised in the
last three months, i.e. in accordance with the annual target of 25.  Three new
correspondents (515 to 517) have been registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> Will technology ever catch up with paper ? </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That s the question posed in the title of a fascinating
paper in Journal of One-Name Studies October-December 2010, which has just
arrived.  It has long been bothering family historians and archivists that the
current recording materials in popular use, CD-ROMs, may have only a limited
life.  After all, in the last 20 years or so, computer users have been through
floppy disks and 3-1/2 inch diskettes, which have not survived.  Acid-free
paper is still the currently preferred medium for the long term and that is
what I shall be using to archive my collection of Whitehouse trees and other
material.  However, a new kind of disk called the  Milliennata  has been
marketed and it is claimed that it should easily last 1000 years.  The snag is
that it requires a high energy laser to write to the disk and so needs a
special drive to  burn  the disk.  The special drive currently costs  900 and
the disk  17 for 4.7 GB of storage.  It s a wonderful step in the right
direction, but very probably will be superseded by something better, just like
the floppy disk and the computer with the 5-1/4 inch drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 2nd July
2010</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>What an excuse !</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The website update is running a little late owing to
blackcurrants and the world cup football.  (Whoops ! Uber den Fussball d rfen
wir nicht sprechen).  The extraordinary hot spell here in the south-east of
England has brought on the blackcurrants and although we have only seven
bushes, the crop is huge and I have been out picking for hours these last few
days.  As for the goings-on in South Africa, the alert among you might have
found that  Findmypast  were allowing free access to their website for a
limited time on the days on which England were playing.  I have taken advantage
of that to add to the growing indexed transcript of Whitehouses in the 1911
census.  By the way, I reckon that there are about 15,200 lines of entry to
complete and I have reached round about the13 percent mark.  Transcription is a
slow and complex job, but it is better to make some progress than none.  If you
find someone there on your tree who is not referenced with the WFHC number in
the right hand column, please let me know.  I should also add that there are
indexing errors in  Findmypast , so this website is a good place to look if you
have failed to find a Whitehouse who ought to be on the 1911 census.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Mining the marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major news this quarter concerns marriages in Aston
Registration District.  Such good progress has been made in  mining  the
details of 515 Whitehouse marriages from Aston church registers in the period
from 1st July 1837, when civil registration began, to the end of 1911 that I am
putting the file on the website, incomplete though it still is: there are 22
Anglican marriages yet to be found.  Interestingly, only 58 of the weddings
took place at the Register Office or in a non-Anglican church, which is a lower
proportion than in Birmingham or West Bromwich RDs.  The Aston RD project was
not originally due to begin until next year, but has been brought forward
because of the success with Birmingham and Kings Norton RDs, the eventual aim
being to offer complete coverage of Anglican churches in the Birmingham area. 
Lindsey Crompton (237) has again been helping me and I am very grateful to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good progress has been made with a similar project in
London.  As many will be aware,  Ancestry  has indexed the church registers
held by the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA).  Of course, we should all be
grateful to  Ancestry , despite the usual gripes about the quality of the
index.  I have enjoyed exercising my ingenuity to find marriages that have been
indexed in the wrong year, under incorrect names or, in one case, filmed but
apparently not indexed.  However,  Ancestry  did redeem itself by correctly
indexing a marriage under  Whitehorne , which the GRO index had listed under
Whitehouse (UN 7059:  Elizabeth Whitehorne, now removed from the main WFHC
marriages database).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excellent though the  Ancestry  index is as a finding aid,
it covers only those records held at the LMA.  I have been searching other
marriages at the Westminster Archives, which are in a side street near the
Abbey.  This is a wonderful place in which to work, with a water dispenser and
coffee machine in a small ground floor room, equipped with four comfortable
chairs and everything well organised in the 5th floor search room.  Yet other
marriages, in City parishes, will probably require a visit to the Guildhall
Library.  I have discovered that at least one large church, Kensington St Mary
Abbots, has not deposited its records in an archive.  That could be a problem. 
Unravelling the mysteries of which churches belonged to which Registration
District at the relevant time is a slow business and I need to get a good deal
further before it is worthwhile putting the database onto this website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Some very strange marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, the Whitehouses have them all - bigamous, under age,
without consent and incestuous.  I have had much cause to reflect on this
subject this quarter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correspondent 513 kindly gave me permission to tell you of
the man who married his niece.  A family from the Redditch area who were needle
manufacturers includes a James Whitehouse (1809-1883) who, after the death of
his first wife, married again in 1847 at Shoreditch St Leonard to Sarah
Whitehouse, who was 15 years younger and the daughter of James  elder brother,
Thomas.  The evidence is extremely solid.  This was no marriage of mere
convenience, for they had four children and correspondent 513 is a descendant
born from one of them.  The tree also contains three marriages between first
cousins.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I had a discussion with correspondent 043 about Emma
Whitehouse and Thomas Swingler, who married each other twice !  The first
marriage took place at the Birmingham Registry Office on 1st March 1883,
Thomas, who was about 6 years younger than Emma, declaring himself to be 21
when he was not.  Eleven months later they re-married at the parish church of
Boldmere, which at that time was a hamlet near Sutton Coldfield, but now
subsumed into the great Birmingham metropolitan sprawl.  Thomas again declared
himself to be 21, which he then was.  It seems that the first marriage must
have been without the consent of Thomas  parents.  This episode set me off in a
quest to discover whether marrying as a minor, without parental consent, would
make the marriage void - that is to say of no legal effect.  The only answer
that I could find, in a time-limited search, is that, if parallel circumstances
arose today, marrying in England at age 16 to18 without parental consent would
not make the marriage void unless notice of objection had been raised either
upon calling of the banns in church or by a written entry in the Superintendent
Registrar s book.  That did not tell me what the law was in 1883.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My request to correspondent 058 for a scan of the marriage
certificate for  his  Alfred Whitehouse to Mary Anne Geer in 1869 at Kensington
St Mary Abbots caused him to remark that Alfred was only 19.  There was no
recorded parental consent.  It paled into insignificance, I told him, beside
another marriage in his very large tree, when Mary Ann Harriet Whitehouse, born
27th November 1841, married George John Fisher, an artificial florist, on 23rd
November 1857 at Paddington Holy Trinity.  She gave her age as 19, but was a
few days short of her 16th birthday.  If the date of birth (which comes from
her baptism in 1843) is correct, this marriage was definitely illegal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were only two or three enquiries this quarter, which
enabled me to get on with the records programme.  One of them was a descendant
of one of the huge tribe of Kentucky Whitehouses (WFHC 137 etc.).  His
information included a Marion Taylor (male) Whitehouse who married Edna Aspey
in 1910 in Indiana, before a magistrate.  He and Edna split up, Marion s draft
record for his service in the first world war said that he was single.  After
the war, Edna was using her maiden name and Marion re-married.  Bigamy ?  Maybe
they got divorced, but my enquirer had another explanation, which related to
Edna s Mormon parentage.  He reckoned that they refused to accept the marriage
as legal, as it did not take place in church.  This set me thinking that if the
Aspeys resided in Utah, did the laws of that state recognise a marriage before
a J.P. in Indiana ?  A cursory look at the marriage laws of US states soon
persuaded me that I had more urgent things to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bigamy in family trees is difficult to prove, but there are
a couple of cases in my records, for correspondents 252 and 510, where the
circumstantial evidence is strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the final  triumph  of the quarter that at long,
long, last, I got round to putting the tree of one of my earliest and most
helpful correspondents (003) on computer.  A George Whitehouse in his wider
family has set a record among Whitehouses, by marrying 5 times, on the last
occasion to a step-daughter (his late wife s daughter by a previous marriage). 
This isn t the first such instance, as correspondent 467 will testify: see  No
laughing matter , Newsletter of 25th September 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It s a very long time since my last correspondence with 044,
but I have digitised her tree and sent it to her last known address.  The tree
contains the marriage of Kate Whitehouse to the brother of her deceased
husband.  Such happenings are fairly frequent, although they were against the
law in Victorian times.  It was not until the Deceased Wife s Sister s Marriage
Act of 1907 that a widower could marry the sister of his deceased wife and, strangely,
not until the Deceased Brother s Widow s Marriage Act of 1921 that a widow
could marry the brother of her deceased husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Dudley non-conformist records</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Surviving Dudley non-Conformist records to 1837 were
transcribed by Arthur Rollason and a book was printed in 1899 entitled  The Old
Non-Parochial Registers of Dudley .  It has subsequently been re-published on a
CD and re-indexed.  I have extracted the Whitehouses and put them into a
spreadsheet format.  I used the diskette of a kind correspondent to check that
I had not missed any entries in the Index Nominum at the back of the printed
volume.  (That index gives only the page on which a surname occurs at least
once, without telling you how many times it occurs, so every indexed page has
to be trawled - very annoying).  To my surprise/horror, I found when searching
the CD that several of the Whitehouse entries simply failed to register, i.e.
the digital search did not pick them up.  Anyway, all s well and it was nice to
be able to use the digital search facility, defective though it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Wednesbury Poor Law documents</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have remarked often that relatively few Whitehouses left
wills before the Principal Probate Registry was established in 1858.  That s
because before the Industrial Revolution they were mainly poor agricultural
labourers and after it they were poor coal miners, iron puddlers, nailers and
engine operators.  Readers will be aware, I hope, that I have put on the
website a very extensive database of Whitehouse wills and administrations, as well
as those (of all surnames) mentioned in them.  Coverage from 1731 to 1860 is
pretty well complete for the whole of England &amp; Wales.  So, what can be
done to get further back when there is no will or administration ?  With such a
frequent name as Whitehouse, parish registers are normally fairly useless, as
are documents that merely contain names, such as the Hearth Tax rolls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Poor law records survive for some parishes.  If you are
lucky, they will have been filmed by the Latter Day Saints and therefore be
obtainable via a local Family History Centre.  Those for Wednesbury have not,
but I went to read some of them at the Staffordshire Record Office, searching
for every Whitehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their holding includes 223 Settlement Examinations
(1740-1801), 108 Removal Orders (1734-1791), 155 Bastardy Bonds and related
documents (1714-1809) and 229 Apprenticeship Indentures (1771-1809).  I did not
search the Bastardy documents, but I did cover the other three sets, trawling
my way gently through the precious originals.  This is not the place for a
discourse on the types of document, the subject being well covered in genealogy
books, but it s nice to list and display some examples that relate to
Whitehouse family history.  My searches revealed the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.  Settlement Examination and Removal Order, dated 2nd
November 1791, relating to William Whitehouse and his wife Ann.  William states
that he is aged 38, originally from Tipton, worked in West Bromwich and then
for about 50 weeks in Wednesbury for one Thomas Lawton, a miner.  At that
juncture he was seized by the parish officers of Harborne (Staffs), having
allegedly fathered a child of Ann Baker of Harborne.  He married her, having
been bribed to do so by the Harborne parish officers.  Evidently, he returned
to Wednesbury, but did not resume employment by Thomas Lawton.  Having obtained
no Settlement Certificate elsewhere and not having worked in Wednesbury for a
complete year (which would have entitled him to a Settlement Certificate in
Wednesbury), his place of Settlement was Tipton, so he and his wife (who takes
the husband s place of settlement) were ordered to be removed there.  That
avoided them becoming a charge on the poor rate of the parish of Wednesbury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.  Apprenticeship Indenture dated 18th December 1795 of
Elizabeth Whitehouse, a poor child aged about 14, to some cotton manufacturers
in Manchester.  These people were obviously looking for cheap labour, as there
were several similar indentures by them at around this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.  Apprenticeship Indenture dated 27th June 1801 of Isaiah
Hughes, a poor child aged about 10, to Joshua Whitehouse of Dudley, nailor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Birmingham area marriages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fantastic progress has been made this quarter, not least in
completing the marriage details index for Birmingham Registration District and
taking the Kings Norton Registration District to the point of substantial
completion, where only a few illegibility problems and minor checks remain to
be dealt with.  These two Registration Districts join Dudley and West Bromwich
in having all the details given on a Whitehouse marriage certificate
transcribed, except the name of the clergyman and whether the people signed or
made a mark.  Coverage is from 1st July 1837, when civil registration began, to
the end of 1911, and is complete for all marriages in anglican churches.  These
four indexes constitute a huge advance in Whitehouse genealogy, especially
considering that they can be sorted by the forename of the father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all who have
helped with these projects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Jayne Sandles (441) for her substantial work on Edgbaston
St. Bartholomew and extracting two entries at Selly Oak St Mary;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Joan Morganti (496) for extracting four entries at Selly
Hill St Stephen and especially for coming to my rescue with a morning s work at
Smethwick Archives, consulting the original paper registers, when I was badly
caught out by illegible microfiche;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Carol Ravenhall (280) for work on the original paper
registers of  Edgbaston St Bartholomew, to solve legibility problems there;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Lindsey Crompton (237) for help with queries in the
registers of Balsall Heath St Paul and Kings Heath All Saints;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Barbara Harvey and Karen Burnell (Guild of One-name
Studies) for providing  cardinal points  for some of the churches and Karen for
other help and advice;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- David Fall (Guild of One-name Studies) for help in filling
in some  holes  in my own extractions; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Netta Hughes (172) for going to the Worcester Local
Studies Centre to obtain particulars of a marriage at Beoley St Leonard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also thank Pat Molloy (409 &amp; 410), who cleared up a
query on my West Bromwich RD marriage project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Help wanted, please</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could do so much more of the marriage details work if I
could get help at Cannock, Walsall or Wolverhampton Local Studies and the same
goes for the Dudley Archives at Coseley, where some of the Stourbridge RD
registers are located.  There have been no offers.  I think I shall simply have
to resort to asking people by e-mail.  The Birmingham area remains unfinished,
as Aston RD has yet to be done, and here I have some basic work to do on the
order in which marriages are arranged in the GRO clerks  books. After this, I
shall need help at the Birmingham Library (again).  Anyhow, please, please let
me know if you could spare a few hours at any of these places.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides help with the marriage details indexes, there is
another area where a contribution could be made without the need to visit a
local history centre or county record office.  It involves use of  Ancestry 
(available in many public libraries - and some people have subscriptions) and
consists of extracting Whitehouse entries from the US census and putting them
onto an Excel spreadsheet.  A helper would be given one state (not a very
Whitehouse-populated one !) and one census year on which to work.  There must
be many people out there in the States who have visited this website and would
like to give back something as a thank-you, so I keep hoping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A quiet quarter</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have been a few enquiries, about seven I think, which
I have answered.  I have registered one tree (513) which I consider of
significant historical interest in the field of needle manufacture in the
Redditch area and contains other interesting features.  Six trees from the
paper files of existing correspondents have been digitised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who have visited the website last year or earlier will
know that I have been registering newcomers, working on their Whitehouse lines,

now closed for an indefinite period, in order to free up my time to work on

<u>P</u>aper-destruction project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While, in general, the Whitehouse Family History Centre is
closed for new registrations, I shall continue to make a few exceptions for
trees that are clearly laid out, properly researched, carefully checked and
replete with occupations, day, month and year dates for Whitehouses and their
spouses and the places of events. Collateral lines, that is to say the brothers
and sisters of Whitehouses not in the direct line of pedigree, and the
descendants of the brothers should be investigated.  A high standard of work
and a clear layout will be required.  I shall also make a few exceptions for
trees that I want to index, because of their historical interest, but I shall
expect to be presented with good research.  Other exceptions might be made, at
my discretion, for special reasons.  Altogether, it is expected that only a few
very well organised and careful enquirers will qualify for registration.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Newsletter reprieved</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As announced in February, I changed my decision of 1st January
2010 not to continue with the newsletter and so it will continue to appear at
around the end of every quarter, when the website is updated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Report of other progress</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three new pre-1837 marriage files, containing witness
information, in Dudley, Handsworth and Kingswinford, are launched on the
website today.  They have already played vital roles in improving trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>West Bromwich baptisms have been targeted, giving
occupations and addresses from 1813 on to as late as 1861.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those wanting early records have been rewarded with a
detailed index to the Sedgley Manorial Rolls.  I give public thanks here to
Janet Rowley for allowing me to use her extracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1911 census grinds slowly on, with the addition of
another 300 lines of entry.  The file is still tiny (there are over 11,000
Whitehouses in the 1911 census), but I felt it worth making a start.  Please
point out to me entries that should be referenced to your tree, as I do not
guarantee to spot them all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A marriages details file for London Parishes (1837-1911) is
making worthwhile progress behind the scenes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A weird story</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How about this for a truly strange genealogical experience
?  On 30th June 1990, a lady telephoned.  She had seen a Family Bible in a
second hand shop, copied down the information from the flyleaf, relating to the
family of Christopher and Esther Whitehouse, and dictated it to me.  I wrote it
down, thanked her very much, asked her name (which she didn t want to give) and
filed it away.  When correspondent 498 contacted me in the last quarter of
2009, somehow or other I managed to recall and retrieve the piece of paper,
filling a gap in his tree and giving useful date information.  I wonder whether
that lady remembers her kind act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Operational review</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In September, I announced that an operational review would
take place at the end of 2009, with a view to reducing my workload.  I warned
of drastic changes.  As mentioned on the index page, one major change is that I
am not accepting new registrations until further notice.  There will be a few
exceptions.  One very obvious exception is that anyone offering (and
performing) substantial amounts of relevant help with transcribing records will
be very welcome to register.  The most relevant help wanted is with marriage
details in the West Midlands.  I want help, please, in transcribing from church
marriage registers in Dudley Archives with Stourbridge Registration District (Kingswinford
area), in Walsall, Wolverhampton and, to some extent, Birmingham for Kings
Norton and Aston.  See also below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shall also make a few exceptions for trees that are

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Popular or what ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last quarter s newsletter contained a buried invitation to
those who had read it to let me know.  There were 14 responses.  It isn t many
among over 500 correspondents, but I thank all who took the trouble to e-mail
me.  I have changed my decision of 1st January 2010 not to continue with the
newsletter and so it will continue to appear every quarter, although maybe not
at the same length as some previous ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Progress report</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I wrote on New Year s Day, I have cleared the backlog
from the last quarter and as of 7th February am fully up to date with the new
registrations.  Last quarter I registered twelve new correspondents, under
references 501 to 512, making 39 for the year (2008:  34).  All twelve except
512 have been linked to existing trees and even there an existing tree was used
to help to unravel a problem.  Progress with converting the paper files of
existing correspondents into digitised trees in 2009 was limited, a matter to
which I turned in the operational review.  In the current year to date, I have
been occupied largely with correspondence and research relating to last
quarter s new trees, but I have digitised four trees of existing
correspondents, creating one new link-up in the process.  Work has started on
new marriage indexes for the late 1700s and up to 1837 in the parish churches
of Handsworth and Dudley in the West Midlands.  There has also been progress with
a marriage details index for Kings Norton Registration District.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Help wanted</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides help with the marriage details indexes, there is
another area where a contribution could be made without the need to visit a
local history centre or county record office.  It involves use of  Ancestry 
(available in many public libraries - and some people have subscriptions) and
consists of extracting Whitehouse entries from the US census and putting them

Whitehouse-populated one !) and one census year on which to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Parish registers in London on-line</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A big thank you to  Ancestry  and the London Metropolitan
Archives for digitising many parish registers in the London area (that we now
refer to as the inner boroughs).  I have been looking at the marriage indexes
and after only a small pilot study have found them unreliable.  Of course,
there are many transcription difficulties, but that is not an excuse for
listing 229 marriages from 1754 to 1921 in the name Whitchouse, which does not
exist except as a misreading of Whitehouse.  That might be forgiven if the
dates were accurate, but they are not.  The pilot study revealed that the
marriage of John Henry Whitehouse to Mary Ann Harriet Lawrence took place in
1836, but the year is indexed as 1834.   Amina Whitehouse s marriage to Charles
Henry Alder took place on 7th August, but the index says the 9th.  In both
cases, the dates are perfectly legible.  Clara Jane Whitehouse married David
Henry Smith, but  Ancestry  overlooked the carat sign for the insertion of his
middle name and indexed him as Henry David Smith.  The incompetence of Ancestry
reached the laughable stage in the marriage of Barbara Whitehouse to Thomas
Henry Clark on Vth August 1900 at Old Brentford, St Paul.  Old Brentford is
just across the river from Kew Gardens, but  Ancestry  confused it with Old
Ford, in London s east end and misread the Latin numeral V as the arabic number
11.  Alas, all this means that nothing in the index can be trusted:  it will be
necessary to look at the image for each individual entry and there are a lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result of this, I have made a start on creating a
London area marriage details file. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A famous Whitehouse</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correspondent 470 has told me that a Joseph Whitehouse
participated in a famous event in US history, the <span style='color:black'>Lewis
and Clarke expedition (1804-06) that explored the territory known as the
'Louisiana Purchase' that was bought from France&nbsp;about 1803.  Joseph was
born in Fairfax County, Virginia about 1775 and later moved to Kentucky. He,
along with others in the party, wrote a journal describing the journey from St.
Louis Missouri to the mouth of the Columbia river&nbsp;on the West Coast.  A
book by Steven Ambrose called 'Undaunted Courage'&nbsp;describes this adventure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More pioneer Whitehouses</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quarter before last, I wrote of my gigantic tree of
Kentucky Whitehouse pioneers.  This last quarter, driven by the arrival of new
correspondents, I have been busy with two more large trees, one of the
Clerkenwell opticians (WFHC 036 etc.), some of whom emigrated to Queensland in
the 1860s and the other of Abel and Matilda Whitehouse of Birmingham, who took
ten children with them to become pioneer farmers in New Zealand.  After early
difficulties, both families flourished.  Again, these large trees have caused
much disruption to other work.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>New addition to the WFHC website</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the New Zealand tree has had the happy consequence
that I have got to grips with the recent New Zealand births deaths and
marriages website:  <a href="www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/search/">www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/search/</a>.  
As a result, I have created a Whitehouse version of the marriages listed there
from 1851 to 1911, with WFHC references added.  This has been uploaded to the
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Eliza &amp; Elizabeth as siblings</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone asked me recently whether it was likely that two
sisters could be named Eliza and Elizabeth.  My answer was that it is rare, but
does happen occasionally.  Now I can cite a specific, well-documented instance,
in the tree of correspondents 080 and 300, where Joseph Whitehouse and his wife
Ellen had Elizabeth born 1857-58 and Eliza born 1869-70 (I have marriage
details for them both and they are co-present on the 1871 census entry). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Discrepant occupations</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another enquirer, Lydia Court, has been e-mailing me about a
marriage of a Benjamin Whitehouse.  He gave his occupation as silversmith and
that of his father, Thomas Whitehouse, as builders clerk.  There was only one
candidate Benjamin, apparently dismissed by my enquirer, because he was an
electroplater.  Moreover, that Benjamin s father, Thomas, was a grinder and at
times a boatman.  On the simple face of it, the occupations were wrong, so how
could he be the right Benjamin ?  Well, electroplater is not so far removed
from silversmith.  The following day, by coincidence, I was researching one Thomas
B Goodfellow who married Henrietta Mary Ann Harriet (&quot;Lilly&quot;)
Whitehouse in 1868.  Here he is on four</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
still doesn t get over the problem of the occupation of Benjamin s father,
Thomas.  My guess is that Thomas was an itinerant knife grinder who used the
canals to travel around.  Maybe Benjamin was ashamed that his father, who was
not recorded as a witness of the marriage, carried on such a lowly trade and so
lied.  I decided that I was right, on the balance of probabilities, to accept
Benjamin as correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Blow me !  You have to be careful with Free BMD
marriages...</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correspondent 296 descends from the second marriage of Alice
Maria WHITEHOUSE, her first husband, Alfred BLOWER having died in 1916.  To
check the date of the second marriage, I searched all people of the name BLOWER
marrying all people of the name MORRIS from 1916 to 1930.&nbsp;  There was only
one success, which was for a BLOWER of the male gender, which was no
good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I searched again, this time putting in only BLOWER Alice
and leaving out the man's name.&nbsp; This came up with a &quot;hit&quot;
showing that Alice M BLOWER married a Mr. NORRIS (March quarter 1917, Dudley 6b
1179).&nbsp; I made another search, this time with just the quarter and the GRO
reference.&nbsp;  It came up with Alice M BLOWER and Thomas MORRIS.&nbsp; This
was quite extraordinary, as it shows that when the GRO cross-references
marriages (which it started doing in 1912), FreeBMD works on the cross
reference (here, erroneously,&nbsp;NORRIS) and not on the individual names
which have the same GRO volume and page number.&nbsp; I was flabbergasted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> Our policy is one of continual improvement </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the subjects seldom aired in these newsletters is
errors in my databases.  Alas, there have been some, but it is very seldom that
anyone has brought one to my attention.  When I find one, it is ruthlessly
hunted down and put right.  So, please point out any that you find, even if
they are just typographical.  This quarter, I found, to my consternation, that
the 1841 census index missorted when it was put into name and age order:  the
names were all right, but a few of the ages were out of sequence, with a few
younger people appearing after the oldest one.  The explanation for this is
that these out-of-order ages were in a different number format and the only way
that I know of correcting this glitch properly is to retype them in the same
format as the others, which I have done.  As I have missed a few, I have fixed
the problem by applying the option to sort  anything that looks like a number,
as a number.   I think all is now well, but if not, please let me know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to marriages and deaths, one of my continual
problems is that people who are really Whitehouses are sometimes indexed under
other names, either because of official error or, as happened recently,
deliberate change of name.  My policy is to regard the name registered at birth
as the correct one and if someone born Whitehouse has changed his or her name
before he or she marries or dies, to index the marriage and death as
Whitehouse, enter  v  in the variants column, and make an entry in the variants
file.  Similarly, if a female of another name marries a male Whitehouse and
changes that name before re-marriage or death, the re-marriage or death is indexed
as a Whitehouse one, with the above variant procedure applied.  The last
quarter featured a family that seemed to have difficulty in deciding whether
they were Whitehouses or Birds or the two in hyphenated or non-hyphenated
combination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These name changes or corrections have a bad effect on my
1837-1911 GRO marriage indexes, where I need to allot each marriage a number
(called the Universal Number or UN for short).  When any marriage not in the
GRO indexes under Whitehouse is added to my database I ought to re-number the
whole database.  That used to be a fairly simple matter.  Now it is more
complicated, because there are marriage detail files which use the same
Universal Number.  So far, only three of these files have been put on the
website, but there are others on my computer in very early stages.  For the
moment, the additions are being numbered as  New 1  onwards and when the
database is sorted into UN order, they appear at the very end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Giant tree causes huge backlog</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter I have spent countless hours working on the
vast tree of James Whitehouse, a pioneer settler in Kentucky in 1783.  The
story behind this tree is wonderful to relate - James is arrested in London for
petty theft, sentenced to death and then has his sentence commuted to
transportation to America.  After a while in Virginia, he is invited to join a
party led by a pioneer explorer, Simon Kenton, to sail down the Ohio River and
settle in Kentucky.  The party is 41 strong and Kenton commissions a boat 120
feet long.  James and his wife, Sarah, become pioneer farmers there and have 15
children, nearly all of whom are known to have survived.  Generation after
generation of Kentucky farmers, with large families, ensue, some moving to the
neighbouring state of Indiana.  Over the years I have  collected  ten
descendants and accumulated a large paper file several inches thick.  At long
last, prompted by the arrival of a new correspondent (239), I have managed to
draft a comprehensive tree, which runs to 60 pages.  This effort, which took
many weeks longer than expected, has caused a large backlog in dealing with the
trees of others who have registered later (495, 496, 498, 499, 341 and 500). 
Mercifully, there have been only 4 new registrations in this quarter - it s
always quietest in the summer - which are 236, 499, 341 and 500.&nbsp;   I
shall try hard to clear this backlog within the next quarter and hope that all
those in the queue will bear with me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the backlog problem, I am urging all those who have
expressed an intention to register to do so this quarter and to submit really
good trees, replete with births, deaths and marriages, day, month and year
dates, places of these events and occupations and to include them for both
Whitehouse and wife/husband, to the best of their ability and knowledge.  As announced
on the index page of this website, I shall be carrying out a review of my work
on Whitehouses, in order to reduce the time spent on this activity to a level
which is sustainable for me.  Absolutely nothing will be treated as sacred in
this review and there will certainly be drastic changes.  <s>By the way, I
wonder how many people actually read this newsletter.  If you are reading this

<p class=MsoNormal><u>US census and marriage indexes launched</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Kentucky farmers tree brought with it the immediate
problem of referencing it and has forced me into starting to index Whitehouses
in the US census and to build a marriage index.  I have decided to index the 1840
to 1880 US censuses in a comprehensive manner, that is to say to cover all
Whitehouses and variants thereon and to progress slowly, state by state.  So,
today I am putting onto the website the 1840, 1850, 1860 and 1870 censuses of
Indiana and Kentucky.  For the 1880 census, I have been able to include two
other states, Illinois and Texas, and calculate that this gives coverage of
about 25 percent of all the USA.  This exercise has been carried out using the
 Ancestry  search facility.  I am sorry to report that there are again many
weird versions of the name in the  Ancestry  index.  Subtle searching has
uncovered some, but probably not all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have no access to official US marriage records, which seem
to be held in the individual counties within the states, and so have decided to
make this file a  refs  one, in which only those marriages that can be
referenced to a Whitehouse tree in my collection, are included.   At present, I
have only indexed the Kentucky farmers tree and one English tree with an emigrant
to the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Dudley baptisms and burials</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has long been a principle of mine to keep improving and
adding to the records on this website, no matter that some correspondence does
not receive attention as promptly as I would like.  The parish church of
Dudley, St Thomas, has long been an annoyance to me, mainly because the IGI
does not cover baptisms in a straightforward way and because the burials are
not in the National Burials Index.  I  have therefore created my own indexed
transcripts covering 1813 to 1846, which have been compiled by  trawling 
through films and using the church s rough draft index and the confusing IGI
batches as checking aids.  In a rare departure from the norm, I uploaded these
in mid-quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Marriage details</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please forgive the repetition, but many readers are still
unaware of the marriage details files now available on this website.  There are
three of them, covering Dudley, West Bromwich and Birmingham Registration
Districts for the years 1837 (1st July) to 1911.  They show everything on the
marriage certificate except the name of the officiating minister or registrar
and whether the parties and witnesses signed or made a mark.  These files have
been compiled from church registers, nearly wholly from those of anglican
churches.  I am very pleased to report that I have been able to add to the
Birmingham file, which now covers 57% of all marriages in that registration
district, up to 1911.  This figure needs to be set in the context that another
16% are non-anglican marriages, the details of which are difficult to obtain,
the GRO being the principal source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A big thank you to Pat Saul (491) and Caroline Whitehouse
(469) who have helped me by looking up a few specific marriages at the
Staffordshire Record Office and Dudley Archives.  Offers of even small amounts
of help are very, very gratefully received.  Chief need at the moment is for
someone willing to look up specific marriage entries at the Birmingham
Library.  Also, I have one marriage that needs investigation at the Sandwell
Library in Smethwick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Newsletter, 30th June
2009</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Want to register ?&nbsp; Join the queue now !</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have been 12 new registrations this quarter (reference
numbers 239, 283 and 489 to 498), making a total of 23 for the half year.&nbsp;
This level of activity is unsustainable for me and something will have to
change soon.&nbsp; The tree of correspondent 493 (Pamela Claire Phillips) is
currently being worked on.&nbsp; Behind her in the queue are 239, 495, 496 and
498 - and some of the trees are large.&nbsp; At the same time, there is
follow-up correspondence, which sometimes involves extensive revision of trees
that have already been digitised.&nbsp; My current advice to anyone wishing to
register is to get in the queue as soon as possible and submit a good quality
tree, replete with exact dates, places and occupations and giving census
references.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people don t understand the registration concept.&nbsp;
They think they are going to be asked to do time-consuming research.&nbsp; They
are not, but they are asked to get together the information that they possess
and present it as a tree in a clear and comprehensible manner, if appropriate
using the materials available on my website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Marriage details</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many readers are still unaware of the marriage details files
now available on this website.&nbsp; There are three of them, covering Dudley,
West Bromwich and Birmingham Registration Districts for the years 1837 (1st
July) to 1911.&nbsp; They show everything on the marriage certificate except
the name of the officiating minister or registrar and whether the parties and
witnesses signed or made a mark.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Dudley Registration District, which covers Coseley,
Dudley, Ettingshall*, Lower &amp; Upper Gornal, Rowley Regis, Sedgley
(including St Mary, Hurst Hill*) and Tipton, the index is complete for all
Anglican churches and gives the detail of 95% of all Whitehouse
marriages.&nbsp; West Bromwich RD covers Birchfield*, Hamstead*, Handsworth*,
Moxley*, Oldbury, Perry Barr*, West Bromwich and Wednesbury.&nbsp; This is
complete for all except 8 Anglican marriages and shows the particulars of 84%
of all Whitehouse marriages.&nbsp; The asterisked parishes are not included in
the West Midlands BMD website.&nbsp; There is still much work to be done on the
Birmingham marriage details file, launched on this website on 20th May 2009,
but coverage up to 1875 is good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Register Office and non-conformist marriages are a great
problem, as an official GRO marriage certificate is usually the only way to get
the details.&nbsp; Both West Bromwich and Birmingham have around 16% of
these.&nbsp; It follows that contributions of scans of such marriage
certificates from correspondents are  valuable  and very welcome.&nbsp; More
generally, I am collecting the details from Whitehouse marriage certificates
and church registers in all areas of the UK for the above time period of 1 July
1837 to 1911, so please send them in.&nbsp; The information is entered onto a
Marriage Details database, so the certificate itself is not a  holy document 
for me and it s fine to scan it in two overlapping portions.&nbsp; This request
applies (1) only to marriage certificates (2) only to marriages which are not
already on the Dudley, West Bromwich and Birmingham files marriage details
mentioned above and (3) only to the time period of 1 July 1837 to 1911 (England
&amp; Wales: starting dates in Scotland, Ireland etc. are later, but the 1911
cut-off remains).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Census transcripts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Astonishingly too, I still get family trees that have
obviously been drawn up without any regard to the 1841-1871 census transcripts
on this website.&nbsp; These are pretty good transcripts and to the best of my
knowledge are highly complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The 1911 census</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This remains primarily a referencing file - an additional
place for correspondents to have their WFHC reference displayed and so enable
contacts to be made.&nbsp; However, in a change of policy from 3 months ago, I
have now decided to admit all Whitehouse-containing households.&nbsp; So,
please send in  bosh shots , making it clear that they have no connection with
your tree.&nbsp; I am using the designation  NRA  (stands for No Reference
Allotted) for these other entries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>More quirks</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wrote in March that the quarter had seen several
oddities.&nbsp; The same is true of&nbsp; April to June.&nbsp; First, there was
the problem in looking for a marriage of William Green Whitehouse at Birmingham
St Philip on 25th May 1855, not present in the Latter Day Saints  film (they
failed to film four pages of a register) and when my colleague Karen Burnell
kindly checked the original register for me, she found that the couple had
never married.&nbsp; Amazingly, the GRO indexed this non-marriage - and Karen
said she had come across another instance of this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of changes of name surfaced.&nbsp; The first is
well documented - a Job Whitehouse who was born and died Job and appears on
censuses as Job, but married in 1906 as Joseph, signing himself in that
name.&nbsp; The second is more  iffy .&nbsp; Correspondent 364 has been looking
for a long time for Charles Whitehouse, a chimney sweep in Tamworth, who was
born in Welford, Northants around 1830, but is absent from the 1841 and 1851
censuses.&nbsp; There were very few Whitehouses in Northants at that time and
none known to be in Welford.&nbsp; His ingenious solution is that his ancestor
called himself Charles Norman in the 1841 and 1851 censuses, for there is a
chimney sweep of that name and of the right age, born in Welford, working for a
Thomas Orme.&nbsp; Presumably he lost his father at an early age and was put
out as an apprentice. The next step for my correspondent will be to search the
Welford parish registers, which are not covered by the IGI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Sedgley Farmers Tree</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The outstanding event this quarter has undoubtedly been the
huge contributions made to the large tree of well off Whitehouse farmers in the
Coseley area of Sedgley (WFHC 148 283 361 427 429 488).&nbsp; First, new
correspondent 283 came up with an old family tree going back to 1640 plus a
family list of births and marriages in the second half of the 18th
century.&nbsp; Then correspondent 488 arrived with extracts from the two surviving,
wonderfully evocative, diaries of Elisha Whitehouse, dated 1819 and 1825,
held&nbsp; by her family.&nbsp; Finally, I was able to link into the tree the
genealogy of the canal carriers, John Whitehouse &amp; Sons of Dudley.&nbsp;
The tree runs to 11 pages.&nbsp; It has occupied a great deal of my time,
partly accounting for the queue referred to above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>West Midlands BMD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wrote last time that I had been investigating  missing 
marriages in the West Midlands BMD marriage index:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://www.bmsgh.org/cgi/marrind.cgi?county=westmidlands">http://www.bmsgh.org/cgi/marrind.cgi?county=westmidlands</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were about 19 Whitehouse marriages that were in the
GRO index under Dudley Registration District, but not listed in this local
index.&nbsp; Eventually, with no help from Dudley Register Office (no response)
or Dudley Archives (passed my enquiry to the GRO, who gave no response) and not
much from the webmaster, I hit upon the explanation.&nbsp; These marriages took
place at Ettingshall Holy Trinity and Sedgley St. Mary (at Hurst Hill).&nbsp; They
don t appear in the West Midlands BMD index because that index covers only the <u>modern</u>
Dudley Registration District which does not now include those two parishes -
they fall within Wolverhampton RD.&nbsp; This means that if you are seeking a
birth, death or marriage within those parishes in the period up to 1911 and
apply to the Dudley Registrar for a certificate, you probably won t get one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Help wanted</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have asked a couple of&nbsp; Whitehouse correspondents for
help with a marriage at Dudley Archives and several at Staffordshire Record
Office.&nbsp; I now need help in Birmingham Central Library and in Cannock,
Walsall and Wolverhampton Local Studies, to make further progress with my
marriage indexes.&nbsp; I do hope that there might be some volunteers - they
will be very welcome.&nbsp; Just get in touch by e-mail and I will call you to
discuss.</p>

&nbsp;29th March 2009</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Records take huge leap forward</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The publication today on this website of two marriage
details indexes is a sensational advance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Between 1st July 1837 and the end of 1911, there were over
1500 marriages of Whitehouses in Dudley Registration District and over 1000 in
the neighbouring West Bromwich RD.&nbsp; Together they make up nearly 30% of all
Whitehouse marriages in England &amp; Wales during this period.&nbsp; The new
indexes include all the essential detail that is found on a marriage
certificate.&nbsp; Coverage is just over 93% of all Dudley marriages and just
over 70% of all West Bromwich ones.&nbsp; The indexes have been compiled mainly
by searching in church records, but with the help of some marriage certificates
for the ceremonies that took place in non-conformist churches and the Register
Office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know that there are imperfections and hope to put them
right before long.&nbsp; In particular the West Bromwich file contains
relatively few entries for Handsworth and tackling this deficiency will be a
priority.&nbsp; I want to thank Pat Molloy (WFHC 409) for recent help in
improving some of the entries from films and fiches at the Sandwell Community
History and Archives Service in Smethwick.&nbsp; Thanks also to Sylvia Peers
(Member of the Birmingham &amp; Midland Society for Genealogy &amp; Heraldry)
who helped me by visiting Dudley Archives and plugging a significant hole in my
records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Whitehouse FHC is keenly collecting marriage
certificates from correspondents, with a view to establishing similar marriage
details files for other areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>1911 census referencing file off to a good start</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another big thank you to all who visited the website and saw
my appeal for entries from this census.&nbsp; Please contribute if you
can.&nbsp; Contributions must (a) contain the Whitehouse name and (b) relate to
your tree (or some other correspondent s).&nbsp; The original schedule is greatly
preferred.&nbsp; I have put the current referencing file on the website - it
contains 17 households.&nbsp; As with the other censuses, this is a sortable
indexed transcript in MS Excel 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>New correspondents</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe it has to do with the 1911 census or maybe it s a
diversion from the economic gloom, but this quarter has seen something of a
tide of new people wanting to register.&nbsp; There have been 11 new
registrations (reference numbers 045 130 349 and 481 - 488).&nbsp; All except
one of them have been linked into existing trees.&nbsp; I have struggled to
cope and the ongoing programme of digitising the trees of existing
correspondents has inevitably suffered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Quirks at the GRO</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter has seen several oddities.&nbsp; The strangest
must be the case of the wrong marriage date.&nbsp; Pat Molloy (above) received
a certificate from the GRO giving the date of a marriage of Sarah Whitehouse to
Edward Green in 1861 as 23rd May, but the church register (West Bromwich St
James) contained no marriage at all on that date.&nbsp; Moreover, the certificate
contained a church register entry number that clearly related to the marriage
of another couple.&nbsp; In fact, the Whitehouse-Green wedding took place in
the next quarter, on 14th July, where it has been indexed correctly.&nbsp; The
explanation for this oddity must lie in a copying foul-up when a copy register
was sent to the GRO and someone had a lapse of concentration.&nbsp; A
side-result is that another marriage was apparently never copied and so is not
indexed by the GRO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another clag-up affected an 1845 marriage at Wolverhampton
St Peter, where Ellen Whitehouse s forename was miscopied as Eliza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone interested in the marriage of Elizabeth Whitehouse to
Joseph Dudley on 13th August 1862 at West Bromwich St. Peter had better beware,
as the GRO have indexed it as Whitehorne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>West Midlands BMD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been investigating  missing  marriages in the West
Midlands marriage index:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://www.bmsgh.org/cgi/marrind.cgi?county=westmidlands">http://www.bmsgh.org/cgi/marrind.cgi?county=westmidlands</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are about 19 Whitehouse marriages that are in the GRO
index under Dudley Registration District that are not listed in this local
index.&nbsp; The worrying aspect is that the missing marriages are not just
isolated quirks, but form parts of significant blocks of missing entries.&nbsp;
Apparently, the West Midlands BMD index has been taken from the index in use at
the Dudley Register Office.&nbsp; If this is true, it means that Dudley RO is
not a comprehensive source.&nbsp; To put it another way, if you apply there for
a marriage certificate and don t get one, you shouldn t assume that the
marriage didn t take place.&nbsp; I have reported the matter to the West
Midlands BMD webmaster and to Dudley Archives, who referred my enquiry to the
GRO in Southport and to Dudley Register Office.&nbsp; More news next time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A French birth certificate</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thomas Whitehouse, a Darlaston coal miner, went to France in
the 1840s, where his son, Thomas was born.&nbsp; Here is the birth certificate
issued by the Rouen registrar in 1844:&nbsp; <a
href="French%20birth%20cert%20TW.pdf">French birth cert TW.pdf</a>
.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that neither parent was present and that it was reported
by the midwife. &nbsp;In the circumstances, one can forgive the mangled version
of Mangotsfield (a village near Bristol) as the place of marriage of the parents
and the Frenchified version of the mother s maiden name of Everett.&nbsp; The
marriage date was also wrong, probably simply guessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>French birth certificates are not easy to find, because
there was no centralised registration system - one has to apply to every town
hall in the area.&nbsp; Here, the WFHC correspondent was fortunate, as the 1881
census said Rouen, and it turned out to be accurate.&nbsp; A little piece of
history came to light, because, apparently a large number of English labourers
was recruited to work on constructing the Paris - Rouen - Le Havre railway
line.&nbsp; Another census indicated that Thomas  daughter, Sarah, was born in
Paris.&nbsp; Alas, the birth records went up in flames in 1871, 8 million being
lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>QUARTERLY RECORDS UPDATE</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Progress has continued at some speed.&nbsp; This quarter has
seen the completion up to date of the 1881 census referencing file, put on the
website for the first time.&nbsp; Referencing files contain only those entries
that relate to correspondents  trees that have been digitised.&nbsp; Thus, this
is in no sense a complete index.&nbsp; It doesn t cover the many trees in my
files that exist merely in paper form and, of course, doesn t cover census
entries that have not yet been related to any Whitehouse FHC
correspondent.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this referencing file has 2614 names, of
which 2046 are Whitehouses.&nbsp; This means that it covers more than a quarter
of all Whitehouses in that census.&nbsp; There are 469 addresses, so the number
of people in each household or extracted from an institution is on average
5.57.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another novelty this quarter is the abolition of the NON-GRO
MARRIAGES file.&nbsp; This was set up to provide a home for marriages between
1st July 1837 and the end of 1911 in which either the Whitehouse or the spouse
could not be found in the GRO index.&nbsp; This database has been gradually
shrinking, thanks to better detective work and removal of errors.&nbsp; At
last, it has got to the point where there are only three missing
references.&nbsp; These have been added to the main file GRO M 1837-1911 and
classed as variants (symbol  v  appears in a separate column in the main file,
which is a prompt to the reader to consult the GRO VARIANTS file to obtain the
name as indexed or a mention that the item is unindexed by the GRO).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A good deal of information (spouses, dates, churches) has
been added to the GRO MARRIAGES file in the last 3 months.&nbsp; I shall be
commenting more fully at the next update due at around 1st April 2009.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inrush of new registrations at the Whitehouse FHC in
December, which has delayed this update, has brought the total for the year to
3<span style='color:red'>5</span> and for the three years 2006 to 2008 to 9<span
style='color:red'>2</span>.&nbsp; These 9<span style='color:red'>2</span> new
registrations have the references 415 to 480, 107, 112, 118, 124, 126, 127,
128, 129, 138, 140, 141, 145, 146, 149, <span style='color:red'>154</span>,
159, 168, 169, 172, 177, 216, 230, 266, 275, 343 and 347.&nbsp; Four
correspondents were de-listed this quarter, since their data did not include a
firm marriage or census reference of 1881 or earlier or, in one instance,
because of a divorce.&nbsp; The numbers were then re-allotted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should be explained that as long as the person is still
contactable, he is given the opportunity to make good the deficiency before he
is de-listed.&nbsp; Previous correspondent 347 is a good example.&nbsp; I
contacted him several times, giving details of the 1890s marriage certificate
that he needed to make progress with his tree.&nbsp; Finally, I was so
confident that the certificate would provide a breakthrough that I offered to
do the further work for him.&nbsp; Alas, he claimed to be too busy to spend a
few minutes on line to buy a marriage certificate.&nbsp; Maybe he just didn t
want to spend the  7. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last quarter, the files of 15 existing correspondents
were put on computer under the RADAP (<u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation
<u>A</u>nd <u>P</u>aper-destruction) project.&nbsp; That brings the grand total
completed to 291 out of 480, which is just over 60%.&nbsp; It seems great,
until one appreciates that the influx of new registrations, the trees of all of
which are digitised straight away, boosts the overall percentage.&nbsp; The
more pessimistic statistic is that there remain the paper trees of 189
genealogies still to be worked on, re-indexed and put on computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>E-MAIL ADDRESSES, POSTAL ADDRESSES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Please, please tell me whenever you change one of these.</b>&nbsp;
Every quarter I spend time in detective work, trying to find correspondents who
have forgotten about the WHITEHOUSE FAMILY HISTORY CENTRE and have changed
their e-address.&nbsp; Usually they are in a telephone directory, so a quick
call does the trick.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to leave a message on voicemail and
get no reply for days (and, in one case, I still haven t heard anything after
several weeks).&nbsp; Sometimes I have to send a letter overseas - at my own
expense.&nbsp; Of course, none of these works when the person has moved and
changed his telephone number and his e-mail address.&nbsp; Occasionally, I get
lucky because someone else knows or because  Google  finds me a business
address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Also, please, please provide me with a telephone number.</b>&nbsp;
It really does remain private and is for my own use only.&nbsp; As stated
elsewhere on the web site, I never give out a telephone number to anyone (not
even a cousin), unless I have specific authority to do so.&nbsp; Discussion is
needed from time to time and, curiously perhaps, people will tell you things
that they have omitted to put in writing.&nbsp; Of course, another main reason
is to provide a back-up for failed e-mails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not sure whether you are a registered correspondent or not
?&nbsp; If you have contacted me during the past 28 years, you probably are,
but, please, just ask !&nbsp; I shan t mind in the least.&nbsp; Contact me by
e-mail:&nbsp; see the Guild of One-Name Studies web site at <a
href="http://www.one-name.org/">www.one-name.org</a>&nbsp; (look under
Whitehouse).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>THE PEOPLE WHO DON T WANT TO REGISTER</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every so often, I encounter an  instant genealogist .&nbsp;
Such people don t want to register, but simply want to extract information from
me and move on.&nbsp; That is a pity, for two reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, my
records are improving all the time, enabling me to create better trees.&nbsp;
Secondly, link-ups with distant cousins can occur at any time and result in
useful new information.&nbsp; Many are created every quarter as new
correspondents get in touch and register.&nbsp; The system really does
work.&nbsp; It s all absolutely free.&nbsp; It has been for 28 years and I have
no plans to change that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a few who do not want to reveal their postal
addresses.&nbsp; So, why do I make this a requirement for registration
?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are my answers:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) Those who provide only an e-address are, in effect,
unidentifiable, that is to say anonymous.&nbsp; Thus, often some of their
information can never be verified, not even their own name.&nbsp; That strikes
at the heart of good genealogy in which people are accountable for what they
have written, encouraging them to be accurate and honest.&nbsp; With a postal
address, someone can knock at the door and meet them.&nbsp; Of course, postal
addresses are divulged only to connected people, usually distant cousins but
sometimes those who are connected by a marriage.&nbsp; I have no intention of
making them available on this web site or publishing them in any other way,
except as a last resort when all attempts at contacting the correspondent have
failed .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) They can change their e-address at any time and there is
then no reliable way of getting in touch with them.&nbsp; Tom Anderson,
believed to be in the United States, last heard of at kerr38@aol.com in
2001:&nbsp; if you are out there somewhere, please get in touch, because I have
now found that your George Whitehouse born 21 Jan 1845 in Tipton links into a
big tree that goes back many generations and is also very  wide .&nbsp; Please
quote WFHC references 145 226 287 421.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c)&nbsp; A few of my correspondents are not on e-mail and
so would be unable to contact the  anonymous  cousin easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the way, I m not anonymous.&nbsp; My address is published
in Registration FAQs and I will give my telephone number, which is
ex-directory, to any registered correspondent who wants to call me for a
telephone discussion.&nbsp; I do meet correspondents from time to time and am
happy for them to come to my home.&nbsp; A little notice is advisable.&nbsp;
Many years ago, someone came from Australia waited for hours on my doorstep
when I happened to be in London all day and my wife was also out.&nbsp; I could
quite well have met him there if only I had known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>EXPERIENCES OF THE QUARTER</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>She married young</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Delving into the tree of correspondent 165, I discovered
that one Hannah Whitehouse, clearly shown as aged 3 on the 1861 census, 13 on
the 1871, married in December 1872, giving her age as 19.&nbsp; She can have
been no more than 15, possibly only 14.&nbsp; This is the lowest
well-documented age at marriage that I have encountered in English
genealogy.&nbsp; However, a cousin of mine in Canada married at 12, when that
was perfectly legal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>A great let-down</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> FIND MORE ANCESTORS ON THE INTERNET  was the cover headline
on the October issue of the monthly magazine  Your Family Tree .&nbsp; We d all
like to do that.&nbsp; I was really interested to learn that  Findmypast  has
produced an index of applicants for passports covering the years 1851-56,
1858-62 and 1874-1903.&nbsp; Here, I thought, would be an interesting way of
finding Whitehouses who went abroad.&nbsp; Alas, reality did not meet expectation.&nbsp;
The information given was merely name, passport number and date, no address or
other details.&nbsp; One had to search year by year.&nbsp; The first two
periods were relatively easy to search, yielding just 13 Whitehouses.&nbsp; I
recognised  Henry B  (August 1854) as probably the iron master Henry Bickerton
Whitehouse and  William M M  (February 1853 and September 1855) must be the
solicitor William Matthew Mills Whitehouse.&nbsp;  Wildman  (December 1858)
equates to Edward Orange Wildman Whitehouse, an inventor who lived at
substantial addresses.&nbsp; The others consisted of two Roberts, two Selinas,
one of them Mrs. Selina, John, David, Rosetta, Joseph and William.&nbsp; This
was a search going nowhere and it got there even faster when I found that for
1874 to 1903 one had to search year by year in a calendar of every surname
beginning with the letter  W , arranged in date order.&nbsp; Needless to say, I
found better things to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>... and another let-down</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assiduous readers of these quarterly newsletters (yes, there
are some !) might recall that I planned to trawl the Annual Reports of The
Royal Surgical Aid Society, which were featured in  Family Tree Magazine ,
August 2007, under the heading  Unusual printed sources .&nbsp; They list
subscribers to the society, which provided surgical aids to the poor.&nbsp; It
turned out that these volumes are so unusual that they are not listed in the
three most obvious places to look, namely the catalogues of the British
Library, the Society of Genealogists and the Wellcome Library.&nbsp; I sent a small
rocket to the editor for not making these checks and not telling readers where
they could be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There s a sequel to this.&nbsp; To her credit, the editor
asked readers for help and one replied.&nbsp; She had found that there is just
one volume of Annual Reports, for the year 1870, in the British Library
catalogue under  Surgical Aid Society  (without the  Royal ) and I have now
been to the BL and read it.&nbsp; The slim volume, measuring about 5 x 7 inches
listed subscribers on pages 13 to 44.&nbsp; There were no Whitehouses and just
11 Smiths, 2 Joneses and 1 Williams.&nbsp; There was nothing to excite members
of the Guild of&nbsp; One-name Studies, as few of the names were unusual.&nbsp;
Indeed, some of these donors were anonymous and postal addresses were not
always given.&nbsp; In short it was a  washout .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apparently, Annual Reports of the Manchester Branch of the
Surgical Aid Society, from 1898 to 1948, are held at the Manchester Archives,
but these are probably too modern to be of much interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Whitehouse industrialists</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are few famous Whitehouses.&nbsp; The most celebrated
Whitehouse is Cornelius, featured in the section on patents in MISC
EXPLANATIONS and below.&nbsp; He wasn t an industrialist in the true sense of
running a large business, but his pioneer invention relating to tube welding gave
rise to many businesses.&nbsp; Three others, who ran large businesses in the
West Midlands in the 19th century, are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry Bickerton Whitehouse, an iron master in Sedgley;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John Whitehouse, a brassfounder in Aston; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>another John Whitehouse, iron master, who owned the Ridgacre
Iron Works in West Bromwich.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All four of them appear in the family trees of WFHC
correspondents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Trees on the web site</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As many of you know, I draw my trees in Microsoft Excel 2003
in a  tall tree  format, with the oldest ancestor placed at the left-hand side
of a portrait page of A4 (210 x 297 mm).&nbsp; The conventional form of chart
is called  drop line  and has the oldest ancestor at the top of a landscape
sheet.&nbsp; A problem with  drop line  is the huge waste of space, made worse
by the use of specialist genealogical computer programs, which are also
objectionable because the ordinary person (not having the right software) can t
read them.&nbsp; Well, I don t mind <u>receiving</u> trees in any shape or
form, so long as they are not digital files written in one of these specialist
formats or in gedcom.&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular legible scans or print-outs are
absolutely fine and if they occupy many pages, I just stick them
together.&nbsp; I re-draw nearly all the trees sent to me in Excel and usually
throw away the originals.&nbsp; So, minor untidiness won t matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For new readers who have not seen any of my trees, I m
displaying today two samples:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cornelius Whitehouse </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John Whitehouse, the iron master of&nbsp;  Ridgacre :&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[Note:&nbsp; these trees have been updated, so the links
have been removed, but they are available from the Index page]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It does take practice and a small amount of  trickery  to
draw trees in Excel and I certainly don t expect my correspondents to amend and
return them.&nbsp; Corrections and additions in prose are absolutely fine, as I
can usually incorporate the changes in seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Strange goings on for  001 </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I look with great affection on my very first correspondent,
Eric Whitehouse, alas deceased, but, happily, replaced by his son.&nbsp; My
correspondence with him began in November 1978 and his early contributions to
creating an index of census entries of Whitehouses were invaluable.&nbsp; We
had in common that we had contemporary ancestors in Birmingham, both called
Charles, both in the industrial quarter, mine a brass founder, his a tool
maker.&nbsp; They weren t related, but we helped each other.&nbsp; Some 15
years afterwards, I was able to join a cousin, WFHC ref. 182, into his tree and
she possessed a family photo taken in about 1856.&nbsp; What joy for Eric s son
and a wonderful advertisement for how the Whitehouse FHC can yield dividends
for the patient.&nbsp; So there, you miserable  instant genealogists  !!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually, the tree originally produced by Eric, although
extensive, was hand-drawn and graphically untidy, which is why I had been
putting off digitising it.&nbsp; So I was very glad when along came new
correspondent 478, with the news that one of his Whitehouse family had died in
Sydney (Australia) in 1884 and that the informant at the death had been one
R.E. Langford, cousin.&nbsp; He identified this informant as Richard Earnest
Langford, whose mother s maiden name was Whitehouse.&nbsp; So far so
good.&nbsp; I had no problem in locating these Langfords as part of the 001 182
family group.&nbsp; However, the nature of the cousinship was far from clear,
so I was driven to re-research and re-draw Eric s tree, aided by a re-processed
version sent by his son and improved records of mine.&nbsp; The mystery is not
yet solved, but is an interesting  talking point .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 001 tree has several interesting features, one of which
is the 1851 census return for Emma Whitehouse and John Harvey, which shows them
as married, when the ceremony did not take place until November of that
year.&nbsp; Her husband, Isaac, had died some years before, so the problem, if
there was one, must have lain with John Harvey.&nbsp; Another feature appears
on Eric s son s re-processed tree, in which he alleges that a 1930s marriage
was bigamous.&nbsp; I am asking him for more about this.&nbsp; A third oddity
is one that Eric and I encountered early on, which is that when Isaac
Whitehouse, the tool-maker, married the above-mentioned Emma in 1839, his
father s name was given as John (his grandfather), rather than Charles (her
father).&nbsp; Isaac was only 18, his father 48 and, to judge from the photo,
had a commanding presence.&nbsp; One can imagine that the incumbent, busily
writing in the church register, said to Charles something like  Name of father
? , as a result of which he gave the name of his own father, rather than
Isaac s, i.e. himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the tree to date:&nbsp; [Tree
updated:&nbsp; please access from the Index page].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The 1911 census beta-test</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of you will know that part of the 1911 census was made
available to interested parties to test, just for a few days around Christmas,
when few of us had any spare time.&nbsp; However, I did explore the website s
capability of producing lists of Whitehouses.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reproduce the whole of my comments would be too tedious,
but to mention some main points:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- The site refused to produce a complete list for any of the
three West Midlands counties, on the grounds that the number was too large (it
ran into thousands).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- An attempt to break down the list into 20 searches of 5
years each hit problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- The search capability was generally poor, with searches by
forename only being disallowed and the lack of the wild card facility so
helpful in  Ancestry .&nbsp; Searches by age were limited to plus or minus 2
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- The index layout was appalling, with huge amounts of space
being wasted, apparently so as to make it as difficult and expensive as
possible to print out a paper list.&nbsp; Editing the list into Microsoft Word
proved very tiresome, with columns having to be deleted, font size reduced,
spaces removed from cells etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I did find one good thing to say.&nbsp; I tested the
incidence of likely mistranscriptions, using three names that don t exist (as
far as I know), with the following result, which is not at all bad:</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>WHITCHOUSE:&nbsp;
21 hits&nbsp; (probably misreadings of WHITEHOUSE)</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>WHILEHOUSE:
3 hits (probably misreadings of WHITEHOUSE)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WATEHOUSE: 2 hits (probably misreadings of WATERHOUSE)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hope that some notice will be taken of my comments, but I
am not holding my breath: doubtless the project has already passed a point of
no return in terms of major changes in software design.&nbsp; The final version
is supposed to be going public in 2009.&nbsp; By the way, there s serious cost
involved in obtaining images of the schedule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What a long newsletter this quarter !&nbsp; Next time, it ll
be a short one and, I hope, more punctual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been a busy quarter, as I have begun work on
establishing a fuller marriage index for Whitehouses, with all the important
detail given on the civil marriage certificates.&nbsp; I shall be concentrating
my efforts first on Dudley registration district.&nbsp; The results of this are
yet to appear on the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eight Lichfield diocese wills and administrations in the
period 1725 to 1730 have been indexed and added to the probate file.&nbsp; The
1891 census of the Cannock area, covering pieces RG12/2220 - 2222, has been
re-launched after checking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 57 new correspondents registered in 2006 or
2007.&nbsp; They have the references 415 to 458, 107, 112, 118, 124, 127, 128,
138, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In the first quarter of 2008, I
registered 6 newcomers, referenced 216 and 459 to 463.&nbsp; In the second
quarter, there were 8 new registrations, numbered 146, 149, 172 and 464 to
468.&nbsp; In the last period, over the summer months, there were another <s>8</s>
&nbsp;9 new registrations, numbered 126, 129, <span style='color:red'>154</span>,
275, 343 and 469 to 472.&nbsp; Once again, some correspondents were de-listed,
since their data did not include a firm marriage or census reference of 1881 or
earlier.&nbsp; The numbers were then re-allotted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The files of 15 existing correspondents were put on computer
under the RADAP (<u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation <u>A</u>nd
<u>P</u>aper-destruction) project.&nbsp; Following an overhaul of my register
and a re-count, the number of correspondents with trees on computer has risen
to 264, which is 56% of the total.&nbsp; It s morale-strengthening to have
crossed the half way mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXPERIENCES OF THE QUARTER</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>No laughing matter</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A new correspondent (467) unearthed a strange event in which
after his wife died, the widower married his step-daughter.&nbsp; James &amp;
Sarah Whitehouse, who lived in Birmingham, married in 1839 and had 7 children,
including Sarah Jane Whitehouse, born in 1847.&nbsp; James, a metal roller,
died at the age of about 45, probably at around 1862.&nbsp; His widow, Sarah,
re-married in 1866 to Thomas Laugher, a wire weaver.&nbsp; The marriage lasted
20 years until Sarah s death in 1886.&nbsp; Just ten weeks after that, Thomas
Laugher married his wife s daughter, Sarah Jane Whitehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This wasn t legitimate at the time, but, perhaps strangely,
it would be now.&nbsp; This is because Sarah Jane was over 18 when her mother
married Thomas Laugher, so Thomas was never in a parent-child relationship with
the step-daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am no stranger to dodgy marriages, as my own ancestor,
Charles Whitehouse, brassfounder of Birmingham and later gas fitter of Dudley,
illegally married his deceased wife s sister in 1844.&nbsp; Amusingly, her
maiden name was Sly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Whitehead rears its ugly head in the GRO index</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correspondent 154, whose native language is not English, has
done exceptionally well to ignore my website and look for a suspected
Whitehouse marriage as late as 1882 in the IGI.&nbsp; Worryingly, from my point
of view, the General Register Office indexed it under Whitehead.&nbsp; I inspected
the church register (Bordesley, St. Andrew) and found that the name was
unmistakeably Whitehouse.&nbsp; After resolving a query about the exact date of
another marriage there, I opened up the tree of correspondent 423 and realised
that there might be a connection to tree 154.&nbsp; So I got in touch with
correspondent 423 - thank goodness she had told me of her new e-mail address,
as she had moved and changed her telephone number - and obtained the evidence
needed to confirm the connection.&nbsp; A link-up was thus created.&nbsp; I
tell the story to show yet again that the WFHC works and to remind all
correspondents please to tell me when they change their e-mail, telephone
number or home address. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Humbled in Bristol</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My good friend Gary (362 &amp; 414) has accidentally humiliated
me by finding his Elizabeth Whitehouse in Bristol in the 1851 census, an entry
not in my database.&nbsp; It seems that part of Bristol was omitted from the
local indexes, probably because it fell into a hole between Gloucestershire and
Somerset.&nbsp; I have carried out Whit* searches in  Ancestry  to plug the
gap, so the 1851 census database is a little larger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The vital clue was a sampler</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A new correspondent added an extra sibling and an unexpected
cousinly tie-up to an existing tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Geoff (343) knew of a sampler dated 1808 which had passed
down his line of descent, but was made by a girl in another part of the
tree.&nbsp; This and other evidence combined together to make a strong case for
a Whitehouse marrying a 1st cousin of another name.&nbsp; It s a reminder of how
well the WFHC can operate sometimes, to the advantage of all who register with
me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The GRO Marriage Index</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing seldom mentioned in these newsletters is the GRO
Marriage Index database.&nbsp; Every quarter it improves in a variety of ways,
through correspondents  trees, by the kindness of fellow-members of the Guild
of One-name Studies who send me entries and by my own searches.&nbsp; Sometimes
the index changes subtly, as this last quarter when a Whitehouse was found who
had been mis-registered as a Whitehead and a Whitehead was found who had been
mis-registered as a Whitehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been reported that the GRO s project to computerise
their births, marriages and deaths indexes and make them available on-line has
run into trouble.&nbsp; The contract has been terminated.&nbsp; This is a great
pity, as we are being deprived of ages at death before 1866 and the names of
spouses before 1911.&nbsp; All this makes me pleased that my Whitehouse GRO
Marriage Index is now a really valuable tool.&nbsp; Very often one finds that
there are so many spouses listed that are not the right ones for a particular
marriage, there is only one possibility remaining and a search in FreeBMD can
provide a degree of confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> A place in the Sun </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volunteers are still hard at work in the Guildhall Library,
London, transcribing the names and addresses from the fire insurance policy
registers of the Sun Fire Assurance Co.&nbsp; They have been working backwards
from 1839 and have now reached 1803, although the index goes only as far as
1808.&nbsp; They hope to join up with the work done many years ago on
1775-1787.&nbsp; The latter project also covered Royal Exchange policies.
&nbsp;I have ordered up some of the registers and thereby have been able to
improve my index of Whitehouses slightly.&nbsp; During this process, I discovered
an entry which had not been indexed in the Royal Exchange names index, but this
joy was offset by failure to find one which was indexed, despite many guesses
at the mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Thank you, Caroline</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Caroline Whitehouse (469) has been kind enough to respond to
my recent appeal for help with the details of Sedgley marriages.&nbsp; Such
kindness gives me a great boost.&nbsp; Is there anyone else who could help with
certain other churches in Dudley and Tipton ?</p>

July 2008</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been a quiet quarter for the WFHC, but three of the
indexes have been considerably enhanced,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>namely, those for the older wills of the Worcester Diocese,
the  Sun  Fire Insurance policies, and Australian marriages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 57 new correspondents registered in 2006 or
2007.&nbsp; They have the references 415 to 458, 107, 112, 118, 124, 127, 128,
138, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In the first quarter of 2008, I
registered 6 newcomers, referenced 216 and 459 to 463.&nbsp; In this quarter,
there were 8 new registrations, numbered 146, 149, 172 and 464 to 468.&nbsp;
Once again, some correspondents were de-listed, since their data did not
include a firm marriage or census reference of 1881 or earlier.&nbsp; The
numbers were then re-allotted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The files of 10 existing correspondents were put on computer
under the RADAP (<u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation <u>A</u>nd
<u>P</u>aper-destruction) project.&nbsp; The total on computer stands at 225,
still not yet half of all Whitehouse genealogies in my files.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXPERIENCES OF THE QUARTER</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many thanks to Netta Hughes, a recent comer to the WFHC, who
very kindly photocopied from microfilm the papers of eight grants of probate or
administration at Worcester, from 1634 to 1729.&nbsp; Of course, I reimbursed
the photocopying and postage costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have placed an order with the
Lichfield Record Office for some wills etc. in the 1725 to 1730 year
range.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lichfield have very sensibly decided to charge a set fee per
will or administration, regardless of its length.&nbsp; Currently it is  4,
which might seem high, but other record offices charge more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The  Place in the Sun  project is a voluntary effort to
index the policy registers of the Sun Fire Office, which are held at the
Guildhall Library.&nbsp; It has been in progress for 5 years and now covers
1808 to 1839 which have been added to my own index.&nbsp; I was interested to
see there two policies taken out by a Nicholas Whitehouse in London in 1814 and
1816.&nbsp; I reckon that he is the same man who was born in 1776 in Worfield,
Shropshire, and in whom correspondent 468 and another enquirer have a passing
interest.&nbsp; Others in that family were known to have come to London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Approaches to me this quarter have been unusually
varied.&nbsp;&nbsp; One newcomer found me from a very unusual
circumstance.&nbsp; He had come upon a census containing the wonderful name
of&nbsp;  Dulevingard Whitehouse , who featured in his tree.&nbsp; When he
searched the forename on Google, my website came up with the sole entry, the
search engine having found it in the Newsletters  Backfile .&nbsp; The name
entered in the census return had been mistranscribed by Ancestry and should
have been rendered as Anlevinyard, which was a phonetic attempt at Ann Livinia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another route to my&nbsp; services came from a tip-off by a
fellow researcher in a library in the West Midlands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two requests for help came from people whose trees had gone
wrong, unknown to them.&nbsp; I was able to set them on the right course.&nbsp;
One of them didn t have a marriage or census of 1881 or earlier and so didn t
qualify for registration and this reminds me to say that I will try to help
with any enquiry.&nbsp; No one is ever left without a reply.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Progress in digitisation ( RADAP ) has been slowed by my
activities in connection with the centenary of the estate on which I live.&nbsp;
I produced a booklet, the research for which involved tracking down the dates
of sale and prices paid for the houses, which were built in the period 1907 to
1914.&nbsp; In this I was aided by the Inland Revenue Valuation Survey of
approx. 1910 and later years.&nbsp; In 1909 and 1910, an Act of Parliament
brought in a tax on the betterment value of the land, the idea being to tax the
difference in value of the land when a house was built and when the house was
ready for occupation and serviced by electricity, gas, water, roads etc.&nbsp;
However, it was applied to all land as it stood on 30th April 1909 and the
 incremental value duty  was levied whenever the property was sold.&nbsp; This
daft Act was eventually repealed in 1920, but before then a small army of
valuation officers went round with notebooks and their calculations seemed to
require ascertaining the total value of the property (not just the
land).&nbsp;&nbsp; In most instances, the name of the owner or lessee of the
property is recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, as in my case, the land was built on
recently, the valuer would often substitute the price actually paid for his
computation of the value.&nbsp; These notebooks, called  field books  have
survived and are to be found at the National Archives, Kew under piece IR
58.&nbsp; Maps which direct you to the right field books are in IR 121, but it
is advisable to obtain help to find the correct map, which is not
straightforward.&nbsp; This little known class of record is in effect a
directory of&nbsp; the UK for approximately 1910.&nbsp; I thought you might be
interested, particularly if you can t wait for the 1911 census to become
public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter has seen the completion of two large
projects.&nbsp; The first is the revision of the remainder of the indexed
transcript of Whitehouse households in the 1871 census, by going through the
counties recently added by  British Origins .&nbsp; The second is an upgrade of
the GRO Marriages 1837-1911, which has involved obtaining more spouses and
churches for the Dudley and Stourbridge Registration Districts.&nbsp; As a
result of this, 61.7% of the marriages now have an assigned spouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two more small, esoteric records have been added to the
Miscellaneous section, Great Western Railway Company share transfers upon death
or marriage and a very few Staffordshire recusants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE  RADAP  PROJECT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This project for <u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation
<u>A</u>nd <u>P</u>aper-destruction is increasingly taking priority over most
other WFHC activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As regular readers will know, I am destroying paper files
and replacing them with a single neat tree, stored digitally and as a printout,
which is being indexed to(principally) :</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pre-GRO marriages (this is a  referencing  file on the
website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GRO marriages 1837 - 1911 on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overseas marriages (this is a  referencing  file not yet on
the website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1841, 1851, 1861 and 1871 censuses on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1881 census (this is a  referencing  file not yet on the
website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The probate files on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term  referencing file  means a file which contains only
entries that relate to correspondents  trees and is therefore not a complete
record of all Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 57 new correspondents registered in 2006 or
2007.&nbsp; They have the references 415 to 458, 107, 112, 118, 124, 127, 128,
138, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In the first quarter of 2008, I
registered 6 newcomers, referenced 216 and 459 to 463.&nbsp; In case anyone is
wondering about the numbering, correspondents  files are being reviewed and
those found not to meet the present day registration requirements, of a
Whitehouse marriage or census date of 1881 or earlier, are being removed and
the numbers re-issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; All have trees stored on my computer, with a
paper printout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the RADAP project, priority is given to the new
correspondents.&nbsp; Last quarter, I warned that there would be a slow-down in
digitising existing correspondents  files.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am therefore quite
pleased to have completed 19 of these, bringing the total to 207, being 45
percent (up from 39 percent at the end of 2007).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXPERIENCES OF THE QUARTER</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Improved 1871 census transcript</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British Origins has been adding more counties to its 1871
census coverage, completing the whole of the 1871 census for England &amp;
Wales, with an index hugely superior to Ancestry s.&nbsp; This caused me to set
aside all other Whitehouse work and check my indexed transcript for all these
added counties, which are Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumberland, Derbyshire,
Durham, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire,
Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Northumberland, all of Wales,
except Glamorganshire, which had already been covered, Warwickshire and
Westmoreland.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Warwickshire, with 891 names coming up
under  Whitehouse All variants , was the biggest task and yielded 16 new
households.&nbsp; It was pleasing that only one Whitehouse household in
Warwickshire was missing from the British Origins index, one that had been
indexed by them as Whitehorn and&nbsp; by Ancestry as Whitchose (picked up by a
Whit* search, where * is a wild card representing one or more
characters).&nbsp; The writing here was a little difficult, but Whitehouse
seemed the best reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the point for half a public apology.&nbsp; Last
quarter I grumbled at the poor quality of some of the images on  British
Origins .&nbsp; In fact, it is possible to zoom these images to a variety of
magnifications, selected from a menu and these images are absolutely
fine.&nbsp; It s only half an apology, because the screen does not explain what
to do and I found out only by right-clicking on the mouse to bring up a menu
that included the zoom !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>GRO Marriage index improved</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was  caught out  by one of my correspondents, who had
assigned a church to a marriage in Dudley Registration District, causing me to
go to the West Midlands BMD website, where I found that the volunteers had done
a lot of further work since my last detailed scrutiny.&nbsp; This caused me to
go through all the marriages in Dudley and Stourbridge Registration Districts
listed in my GRO index (1837 - 1911) transcript, matching them up to those
found in West Midlands BMD and then using Free BMD to verify the spouse
names.&nbsp; It was very time-consuming, but worthwhile.&nbsp; Some problems
resulted, not least the fact that more than 40 GRO Whitehouse marriages are
missing from the West Midlands BMD index.&nbsp; Also, I would like to thank
correspondent Andrea Hackney for making available to me a Short Heath
(Willenhall) Holy Trinity transcript, enabling me to add details of about 20 additional
marriages there.&nbsp; With other contributions and researches, the number of
marriages with an assigned spouse has risen this quarter by 700 and now stands
at 5495 (61.7%).&nbsp; Of course, eventually, when the GRO digitisation project
has been completed (2009 ?), all marriages will be cross-referenced by spouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One anomalous marriage turned out to be of an Elizabeth
Woodhouse in 1849 at Dudley St. Thomas, which the GRO had indexed as both
Whitehouse and Woodhouse.&nbsp; Having verified Woodhouse from the church register,
I removed it from the GRO index transcript.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Already, I am planning the next stage, which is to expand my
marriage index to include nearly all the full details that are shown on a
marriage certificate.&nbsp; A pilot exercise, for Dudley St. Thomas, is in
progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Esoteric records</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The MISC EXPLANATIONS file has been expanded slightly, now
including the GWR Shareholders index, newly created by the Society of
Genealogists.&nbsp; This isn t quite the exciting or lengthy document that
might appear from its name, because it relates only to transfers that occurred
outside the stock market, i.e. chiefly upon, death, marriage or change of
name.&nbsp; However, some of the more prominent Whitehouses have been
identified in it and a WFHC reference assigned to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had planned to trawl the annual reports of The Royal
Surgical Aid Society, which were featured in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Family Tree Magazine , August 2007, under the heading
 Unusual printed sources .&nbsp; They list subscribers to the society, which
provided surgical aids to the poor.&nbsp; It turned out that these volumes are
so unusual that they are not listed in the three most obvious places to look,
namely the catalogues of the British Library, the Society of Genealogists and
the Wellcome Library.&nbsp; I sent a small rocket to the editor for not making
these checks and not telling readers where they could be found.&nbsp; I did
subsequently receive a couple of suggestions, but to my way of thinking the
author of the article (John Titford) ought to have done his homework properly
and not placed the burden on the reader.&nbsp; Somehow, I don t think my letter
to the editor of FTM will be published.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Thank you, Andrew and Jean</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My public thanks to Andrew Clayton of Tipton, who has
contributed Dudley material to my paper collection.&nbsp; He has been a kind and
assiduous researcher, so I pulled his file out and digitised it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I digitise files, I work on them to ensure that I index as many marriages,
censuses and probates as I can find, often extending the tree sideways to cover
the marriages of brothers and sisters and sometimes going further back than the
correspondent.&nbsp; I hope I have  added value  to Andrew s, although his was
one of the better researched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been a quiet quarter as regards improving the
records, because I have been giving as much impetus as I can to the RADAP
project (see below).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I have completed the first stage of
checking the 1841 census for the West Midlands, covering the whole of
Registration Districts 977 to 985, 996 and 997.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British Origins has recently been adding more counties to
its 1871 census coverage and so I have started the big task of checking my
transcript, using the British Origins index.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a bit of light relief, I have extracted the Whitehouses
from the new  Civil Service Evidence of Age Index , which is on the
 Findmypast  website - there were just three ! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE  RADAP  PROJECT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This project for <u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation
<u>A</u>nd <u>P</u>aper-destruction is increasingly taking priority over most
other WFHC activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As regular readers will know, I am destroying paper files

<p class=MsoNormal>The probate files on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term  referencing file  means a file which contains only
entries that relate to correspondents  trees and is therefore not a complete
record of all Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 57 new correspondents registered in 2006 or
2007.&nbsp; They have the references 415 to 458, 107, 112, 118, 124, 127, 128,
138, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In case anyone is wondering about
the numbering, correspondents  files are being reviewed and those found not to
meet the present day registration requirements, of a Whitehouse marriage or
census date of 1881 or earlier, are being removed and the numbers re-issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All have trees stored on my computer, with a paper printout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the RADAP project, priority is given to the new
correspondents.&nbsp; The general aim to deal with all these and to meet a
target of computerising the trees of  old , pre-2006 correspondents at the rate
of 25 per quarter.&nbsp; It is hard going, mainly because nearly all the trees
have to be re-drawn and many need  armchair searching , as I call it.
&nbsp;Altogether, I have completed the trees of 182 correspondents, which is 39
percent of the total of 457.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There will be a slow-down during the next half of the year,
because I need to complete the writing up of my Butler and McCreath family
histories, as well that of as my own Whitehouse line.&nbsp; However, I shall
give prompt attention to all new correspondents, as usual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Experiences of the quarter</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Genealogically stated, this has been a very disrupted
quarter.&nbsp; After 24 years, I have re-decorated my study.&nbsp; This was no
small job, as it meant taking down wall furniture, making good some damaged
plaster, bricking up a fireplace, re-plastering a wall, making a new giant
notice board (if anyone would like to know how to make one - mine is 5 ft 7 in
long x 4 ft high x 27 mm thick - get in touch), mending a bookcase, re-hanging
the wall furniture in different positions etc.&nbsp; These works produced a
knock-on disturbance in other rooms and have generated a major re-organisation
of where things are kept.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I have operating a taxi service, as
our teenage granddaughter is lodging with us while she completes her GCSE
exams.&nbsp; Her parents had to move to Wales rather suddenly when my son
changed his job.&nbsp;All this - and other things - have curtailed my
Whitehouse activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last quarter I wrote about finding a gap in my records for
the 1851 census in which the village of Shelford, near Walsall, had been
omitted.&nbsp; It was not too surprising to find shortly afterwards that there
was a corresponding gap in my 1841 census transcript.&nbsp; It seems that I had
assumed that the local index that I used covered the whole of the area
surrounding Walsall, when it did not.&nbsp; On looking it up in  Ancestry , I
discovered that all 4 households had been misindexed by  Ancestry  - as
Whitchana, Whitchonse, Whitchouse and Whitchover.&nbsp; You have been
warned.&nbsp; For many further examples of misindexing, see the CEN
EXPLANATIONS file elsewhere on this site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another interesting discovery was that  Ancestry  have not
filmed or indexed part of the 1841 census of Willenhall, in the area of
Waterglade (HO 107/985/5, ED3).&nbsp; I think that they came upon a blank page
and assumed that this was the end of the book, when it wasn t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is most pleasing to see that  British Origins  has made
some further progress with indexing the 1871 census, alas spoilt by the poor
quality of its images.&nbsp; Many are simply unreadable.&nbsp; I am having to
use the  British Origins  index to check my own database for completeness and
then go to the excellent images in  Ancestry  to read the entry [see 27th March
2008 Newsletter for partial retraction].&nbsp; As mentioned above, this is in
progress, with Berkshire and Kent of these additional counties checked for
completeness.&nbsp; Kent was all right, with just one additional Whitehouse in
the muster for HMS Pembroke, moored in Sheerness harbour.&nbsp; Berkshire gave
rise to 5 extra households, 3 definite Whitehouses and 2 which might be.&nbsp;
Of the latter, one was born in Uffington, something of a stronghold of
Whitehorns, but the writing is so poor that one cannot say definitely which it
is.&nbsp;  Ancestry  indexed it as  Whilelanse  - no comment !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The keen-eyed will have noticed that my version of the
marriage index for England &amp; Wales (Whitehouse and variants) has acquired a
net 4 additional lines of entry - 5 additions and a deletion.&nbsp; Three of
the extra lines arose because some Whitehouses in the tree of correspondent 453
changed their name to Willetts and married under the latter name.&nbsp; My
practice is to count this as a variant and include it.&nbsp; By the way, this
family came from Cradley, but there is an entirely separate Whitehouse family
connected with Willetts, in Northfield.&nbsp; The other two additional lines
are for Whitest.&nbsp; This relates to a family from Cudham and Chelsfield in
Kent, in which the parish register contains a bewildering variety of phonetic
names, mainly Whitest or Whitehouse, but bizzarely including a Waterhouse, a
Whites and a Whitehurst in the 1790s.&nbsp; The confusion continued right
through the first half of the 19th century and even beyond.  On the other hand,
a marriage indexed by the GRO as Whitehouse turned out to be a Whitehorn and
was accordingly removed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, marriages continue to be  mined  for the index,
which now contains a huge number of spouses.&nbsp; I should here just reinforce
the point that my index differs from that offered by Freebmd.&nbsp; Freebmd
just gives the total entries that have the same district, volume and page
number in the General Register Office Index.&nbsp; For a spouse to be entered
in my index, there must be (a) evidence that the marriage has taken place
between the Whitehouse and listed spouse <u>plus</u> (b) the same district,
volume and page number as in the official index.&nbsp; The promised new
official index, which will give names of spouses for 1837 to 1911, has been
delayed and is now scheduled for mid-2009.&nbsp; I ll believe that when I see
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Registration requirements</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have altered the REGISTRATION FAQs document, because I
think that the list of requirements looks too off-putting.&nbsp; I have
scrapped the need for a chart.&nbsp; Most correspondents fall into two
categories - those that are rubbish at drawing charts and those that are highly
adept at using genealogy programs, which occupy a lot of digital space and
print out on reams of paper !&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally stated, nearly all the
information that I receive is under-researched for my purposes and needs
further work.&nbsp; So, it s better for me just to draw or re-draw the tree in
my preferred format,  Tall Tree , using a spreadsheet.  I ve been wondering
about whether to put on the website some instructions for drawing a  Tall Tree 
in MS Excel, so let s see whether anyone reads this and asks for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the third quarter of 2007 I have done a lot of further
work on records:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the probate index has been extended from its present end
in 1947 up to 1950, involving 185 additional grants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Irish and Jersey marriages have been covered for the first
time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Some Australian marriages are included for the first time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the seven Whitehouses from Boyd s London Burials Index
(burial dates 1612 to 1817) are listed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a major new index has been completed, of admissions to the
county lunatic asylums in England &amp; Wales, 1846 to 1890 with a few gaps</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the project to check the 1841 census of the West Midlands
against the  British Origins  index has covered West Bromwich, Darlaston,
Handsworth &amp; Smethwick, Tamworth and Tipton (pieces HO 107/977 to 982)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE  RADAP  PROJECT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This project for <u>R</u>e-indexing, <u>A</u>rchiving,  <u>D</u>igitisation
<u>A</u>nd <u>P</u>aper-destruction is increasingly taking priority over most
other WFHC activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As regular readers will know, I am destroying paper files
and replacing them with a single neat tree, stored digitally and as a printout,
which is being indexed to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp; Pre-GRO marriages (this is a  referencing  file put
on the website for the first time this quarter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp; GRO marriages 1837 - 1911 on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3 to 6.&nbsp; The 1841, 1851, 1861 and 1871 censuses on the
website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.&nbsp; The 1881 census (this is a  referencing  file not
yet on the website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8.&nbsp; The probate files on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, I have just begun constructing a  referencing
file  of overseas marriages and would welcome contributions from
correspondents.  The term  referencing file  means a file which contains only
entries that relate to correspondents  trees and is therefore not a complete
record of all Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, I have the trees of only 143 of my 453
correspondents (32%) in this form.&nbsp; They include those of the 51  new 
correspondents, who registered in 2006 or 2007.&nbsp; They have the references
415 to 453, 107, 112, 118, 124, 127, 138, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and
266.&nbsp; In case anyone is wondering about the numbering, correspondents 
files are being reviewed and those found not to meet the present day
registration requirements, of a Whitehouse marriage or census date of 1881 or
earlier, are being removed and the numbers re-issued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BMD EXPLANATIONS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This file replaces GRO Explanations, since its contents have
broadened beyond the GRO England &amp; Wales and now includes material not
connected with any register office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Genes Disunited ?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I had a hot match on Genes Reunited with someone&nbsp;who
had an Elizabeth Whitehouse born in 1835 but the parents were not right.&nbsp;
I told them about you. &nbsp; This was from correspondent 031, who was very
grateful for a small piece of detective work that I did in order to tidy up her
tree:&nbsp;  This means that I now have my 16 grt grt grandparents. I had given
up hope of ever finding Hannah's 1828 mother's maiden name.   Of course, I
don t sneer at Genes Reunited, because several people have found distant
cousins that way.&nbsp; It s a valuable resource.&nbsp; However, many trees
require additional input in order to make connections with such relatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>What the WFHC is all about</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quarter there have been two other excellent examples of
how WFHC correspondents benefit from registering their trees with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correspondent 288 referred to two sisters, Gertrude and
Mabel Whitehouse.&nbsp; These matched with names in a  birthday book  inherited
by correspondent 163 and so I was able to connect up the trees, with the result
that correspondent 288 obtained a tree going back to a 1781 marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It turned out that new correspondent 124 takes piano lessons
from a lady that I know who lives just down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; So she was
able to drop in a copy of her handed-down manuscript tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
contained a vital clue, in the form of mention of an Aaron Whitehouse as a
brother of 124 s ancestor, William.&nbsp; Aaron had no dates and couldn t be
found in the IGI.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Aaron is a very rare forename and when
Aaron and Sarah Whitehouse turned up as witnesses to the marriage of a William
Whitehouse, 124 s ancestor, I knew that he could not have died young.&nbsp;
Sure enough, a marriage of an Aaron Whitehouse to a Sarah was found and their
children fitted perfectly with the tree of correspondent 085.&nbsp; In the end
a 6-page tree linking these two and a third correspondent (342) was
constructed.&nbsp; The handed-down tree went back to a 1788 marriage, so 085
and 342 were delighted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The WFHC benefits too</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was simultaneously pleased and annoyed when correspondent
452 had roots in Shelfield, near Walsall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This correspondent included an 1851 census reference not in
my file.&nbsp; On investigation, it turned out that there are 4 Whitehouse
households in this village, all omitted from my indexed transcript.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I still do not know how this error occurred, as I thought I had used both a
local printed index and the BMSGH (Birmingham &amp; Midland Society for
Genealogy &amp; Heraldry) published index for Staffordshire.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
would have come to light sooner or later, since I have an ongoing project to check
the whole of the 1851 census for Staffordshire in Ancestry.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, with the RADAP project having priority, progress has been very
limited.&nbsp; As a stopgap measure, I have checked the whole of piece
HO107/2023, which covers Walsall and some outlying villages, in Ancestry, for
omissions.&nbsp; There were no others, I am glad to say, but this check threw
up some interesting misreadings of forenames by Ancestry.&nbsp;  Buche  is
Phoebe,  Dulevingard  is Anlevinyard (registered as Ann Lavinia),  Ish  is Job,
 Jerm  is James (not Jeremiah, abbreviated),  Mary , aged 4, listed in the male
(!) section of the Walsall Union Workhouse, is Henry and another  Mary , aged
14, is poorly written but probably Fanny.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp; If
you couldn t find it in Ancestry, try here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Pre-GRO marriages referencing file</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This index of marriages in correspondents  trees that took
place in England &amp; Wales before civil registration began on 1st July 1837
has been under construction for some while.&nbsp; As I keep explaining, to
avoid misunderstanding, this is a  referencing file .&nbsp; That is to say, it
contains ONLY marriages on correspondents  trees, referenced with their WFHC
number.&nbsp; I have been adding to it slowly, as I have been re-indexing trees
to the website.&nbsp; I have proceeded systematically, taking each tree in
turn, because as records have improved, I have often been able to add more
marriages than I have on my old card index or are evident from the existing
tree.&nbsp; So far, the index has just over 200 marriages.&nbsp; I have been
reluctant to put this  embryonic file  on the website, because I doubt that the
general public of Whitehouse researchers will understand that it is highly
incomplete, with only 32% of correspondents having been indexed or re-indexed
under the RADAP project.&nbsp; However, I have taken that chance and uploaded
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Contacting me</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please see Section 6 of REGISTRATION FAQs.&nbsp; At least
some people manage to work out that the 10-letter surname is Whitehouse, the
three initials are fhc and the supermarket is Waitrose.&nbsp; Regrettably, despite
my efforts, the WFHC e-mail address is now being spammed and also attacked by
virus-laden e-mails (intercepted by my isp before they even reach my own
anti-virus protection).&nbsp; The latter probably means that there is a
Whitehouse correspondent out there with my address in an infected
computer.&nbsp; I urge all my correspondents to ensure that they have
up-to-date virus protection.</p>

2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second quarter of 2007 has seen some further progress in
improving the records:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the quality control project for the 1861 census,
previously completed for the whole of Staffordshire, has been completed for
Worcestershire and rural Warwickshire</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the project to check the 1871 census of Staffordshire and
Worcestershire sections, against the  British Origins  index has been completed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a project to check the whole of the 1841 census of the
West Midlands against the  British Origins  index is under way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- more details have been added to the GRO marriage index</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE  RADAP  PROJECT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The records improvement programme will be slowing for a
while, because I have to get on with the indexing and archiving of
correspondents  trees.&nbsp;&nbsp; As regular readers will know, I am
destroying paper files and replacing them with a single neat tree, stored
digitally and as a printout, which is being indexed to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp; Pre-GRO marriages (this is a  referencing  file not
yet on the website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp; GRO marriages 1837 - 1911 on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3 to 6.&nbsp; The 1841, 1851, 1861 and 1871 censuses on the
website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.&nbsp; The 1881 census (this is a  referencing  file not
yet on the website)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8.&nbsp; The probate files on the website</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, I have just begun constructing a  referencing 
file of overseas marriages and would welcome contributions from correspondents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term  referencing file  means a file which contains only
entries that relate to correspondents  trees and is therefore not a complete
record of all Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, I have the trees of only 120 of my 450 or so correspondents
in this form.&nbsp; They include those of the 44  new  correspondents, who
registered in 2006 or 2007.&nbsp; They have the references 415 to 450, 112,
118, 140, 159, 169, 177, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In case anyone is wondering about
the numbering, a few correspondents  files were reviewed and found not to come
anywhere near meeting the present day registration requirements, of a
Whitehouse marriage or census date of 1881 or earlier.&nbsp; A couple turned
out not to be Whitehouse, but Whitehurst and Woodhouse.&nbsp; These earlier
numbers (112, 118 etc.) were therefore vacated and used up for some of the 2006
&amp; 2007 intake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BIG UPHEAVAL AS CENSUS FILES ARE MERGED</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, I took a hard decision - to merge my census files for
the West Midlands, with those of London and all the rest of England &amp;
Wales, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.&nbsp; They have become one giant
file designated E&amp;W.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that so many people have broadband,
these big files are more realistic.&nbsp; It will make searching simpler and
will save me time when I update the files and load the new version onto the
website.&nbsp; To achieve this, I have added county codes (STS, WAR, WOR) to (I
hope) all the addresses in the West Midlands, as well as to 1851 London.&nbsp;
If you find an address without a county code or with the wrong one, please let
me know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BACK NUMBERS OF NEWSLETTERS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another change is that I have merged all the old newsletters
into a single file, slightly edited.  They are arranged with the most recent
first and go back to December 2005.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Surprise, surprise</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I m quite used to surprising other people with a missive
beginning:&nbsp;  Further to my letter of 16th November 1982, I am enclosing an
improved tree... &nbsp;&nbsp; The WFHC (previously the Whitehouse Information
Centre) began in April 1981.&nbsp; Recently, it has been my turn to be
surprised, by a correspondent who found a circular letter that I sent in 1980
to some Whitehouses in New York.&nbsp; His grandfather had responded to my
circular and in doing so had preserved vital genealogical information.&nbsp;
So, I linked him up with an English cousin and now a huge team of people is
working on their family tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a convenient point to say that if ever anyone has
been in touch with me in the past and they have a  serious  tree - or even a
single event - in the Whitehouse name and it includes a marriage or census
entry of 1881 or earlier, they are registered with me and are liable to be
contacted.&nbsp;&nbsp; To save me trouble, it always helps if such people would
contact me - even if just to say  Hello, I m still alive  or  I m now on e-mail .&nbsp;
It doesn t matter if they are not sure whether they are registered:&nbsp; I can
track them down in my register spreadsheet and provide them with their
reference number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Correspondent 441 and the missing Samuel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samuel Whitehouse, a butcher, was missing from my 1841 and
1851 census databases.&nbsp; Assiduous researcher Jayne Sandles (441) found him
on the 1841 census in Tettenhall, near Wolverhampton.&nbsp; This caused me
mega-embarrassment, because he was not on my indexed transcript.&nbsp; To my
horror, I found that my trawl of Sedgley (piece 998) had not covered the last
three books, 16 to 18, which relate to the Tettenhall area.&nbsp; The mistake
went unnoticed because this area is split between two pieces, 998 and 1002, the
latter having been covered.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, I have searched the whole
of piece 998, using the Ancestry index and the name Whit*, where * is a wild
card denoting one or more subsequent characters.&nbsp; There was one further
omission within the three unsearched books, but mercifully the remainder of 998
was complete.&nbsp; It s a reminder that I am not infallible and it has
hastened the launch of a project to check the 1841 census of the West Midlands
using the  British Origins  database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it came to the 1851 census, Jayne showed that she is a
fine researcher.&nbsp; She was convinced by directories that Samuel Whitehouse,
the butcher, must have been living in Bilston Street, Wolverhampton, yet he was
not in my indexed transcript, nor could she find him by using  Ancestry , not
even by searching under Whit*.&nbsp;&nbsp; A careful search street by street
revealed an entry that was unmistakeably what she sought, but the head of
household had been entered very clearly as James Whishine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can
guess what happened.&nbsp; Samuel, like many tradesmen, could probably write.&nbsp;
He filled in the census form, writing his name as Saml Whitehouse, but the
enumerator misread it and copied into his schedule as James Whishine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The proximity thing and the balance of probabilities</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two trees of brickmakers were connected in this quarter,
when the 1861 census showed Whitehouses from each tree adjacent in the 1861
census.&nbsp; It was just too much of a coincidence and a good tree could then
be constructed, showing that they were very probably second cousins.&nbsp; Its
probable correctness was reinforced by a strong naming pattern, involving
Aaron, Moses and Stephen, all relatively rare names.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It reminds me to say that the standard that I apply in
indexing and in drawing up trees is that the entries and the trees are correct
on the balance of probabilities.&nbsp; This is a lower standard than  beyond
reasonable doubt .&nbsp; My reasoning is that if I include someone in an index
who shouldn t be there, my worst sin is to have misled someone and if I am
wrong, other events will show this.&nbsp; On the other hand, if I have failed
to index someone, I might have deprived researchers of a valuable clue.&nbsp;
Whenever I feel some degree of uncertainty, I apply a question mark (query
symbol). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> I can t find my tree on your website </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I know.&nbsp; No trees are on the website.&nbsp; The
long term aim is to put them on, partly for archiving purposes, but this will
require 1 to 1.5 GB of web space, which, in turn, means using a paid-for web
host.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would entail some disruption and I am reluctant to divert
myself from more pressing matters, not least the RADAP project.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, I will send any registered correspondent their own current tree or
anyone else s, so long as they have a good reason.&nbsp; For example,
correspondent 095 does not believe that the tree that I have drawn is correct,
because she thinks that  her  Job Whitehouse is the one which I have assigned
to the tree of correspondent 212.&nbsp; So, I have sent her tree 212 and she
can check it out for herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the sake of good order, I re-affirm that no
correspondent s identity and address are revealed to another correspondent,
unless they have a genealogical connection (or, in cases of doubt, unless both
of them first agree).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u> I can t read the tree that you sent me </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All but a few of my collection of trees have been drawn or
re-drawn by me in Microsoft  Excel  2003.&nbsp; I like this widely available
program, because it is so easy to alter and re-arrange information, join two
trees together etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Excel is part of MS Office and is widely
used as a spreadsheet for keeping accounts and creating financial charts.&nbsp;
Less widely known is that one can draw in it, using the cells for guidance to
keep the tree straight.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who don t have Excel can still read the tree, either
by downloading an Excel 2003 reader from the Microsoft website or by installing
the free  Open Office  suite.&nbsp; The latter is the better option, because
one can then also re-sort the downloaded indexes on my website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Pre-GRO marriages index</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This index of marriages in correspondents  trees that took
place in England &amp; Wales before civil registration began on 1st July 1837
has been under construction for some while.&nbsp; As I keep explaining, to
avoid misunderstanding, this is a  referencing file .&nbsp; That is to say, it

than I have on my old card index or are evident from the existing tree.&nbsp;
So far, the index has 177 marriages.&nbsp; I am reluctant to put this
 embryonic file  on the website, because I doubt that the general public of
Whitehouse researchers will understand that it is highly incomplete, with only
26% of correspondents having been indexed.&nbsp; However, I do aim to take that
chance and upload it at the end of this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE, 1ST APRIL 2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first quarter of 2007 has been another of good progress:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the name has been re-registered with the Guild of One-name
Studies and applications for registration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of trees at the WFHC have been dealt with promptly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the quality control project for &quot;1861 CEN WMIDS&quot;
has been completed for the whole of Staffordshire and some parts of
Worcestershire, pieces RG9/2019 to 2069</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the project to check  1871 CEN MIDS , Staffs and Worcs
sections, against the  British Origins  index has made excellent progress, with
Staffordshire nearly finished</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a draft of the 1871 census of Scotland has been added</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- improvements in the GRO marriage index by the addition of
some more spouse names and WFHC references</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the non-GRO Marriage Index has been greatly improved,
chiefly by the finding of spouses with matching page references and
transferring them to the GRO marriage Index</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the Probate Grants index for the principal probate
registry (England &amp; Wales) has been extended by 4 more years, so that it
now covers 1858 to 1947 (dates of grant).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Lost correspondents</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to draw everyone s attention to a small change
in the Registration FAQs document.&nbsp; I am having trouble contacting some of
my pre-2006 correspondents and now reserve the right to publish their last
known addresses and genealogical details.&nbsp; People change their internet
service providers and then I lose contact by e-mail.&nbsp; My next step is to
try to find them by using the  Google  search engine.&nbsp; That sometimes
works.&nbsp; Step 3 is to look them up in an on-line telephone directory.&nbsp;
If that fails, I write a letter to their last known address.&nbsp; When my
letter is returned or I get no response, I declare contact to be lost and mark
the register  LC .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I work to long timescales here.&nbsp; The case of tree 009
029 417 418 is salutary.&nbsp; My last correspondence with 009 was in 1983,
when I could not help much, because of the inadequacy of my records then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2006, I registered 417 and within a couple of days had
connected her to another new correspondent, 418.&nbsp; Recently, improved
indexing enabled me to see that 009 also belonged.&nbsp; Fortunately, a
 Google  search enabled me to contact him after 25 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please do not let yourself become an LC !&nbsp;&nbsp; Put my
e-mail address into your address book, so that when you change your e-address,
you will be prompted to update me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The big task ahead</u></p>

will know, I am destroying paper files and replacing them with a single neat

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, I have the trees of only 90 of my 444
correspondents in this form.&nbsp; The 90 includes those of the 37  new 
correspondents, who registered in 2006 or 2007.&nbsp; They have the references
415 to 445, 112, 118, 159, 169, 230 and 266.&nbsp; In case anyone is wondering
about the numbering, a few correspondents  files were reviewed and found not to
come anywhere near meeting the present day registration requirements, of a
Whitehouse marriage or census date of 1881 or earlier.&nbsp; &nbsp;These
numbers (112, 118 etc.) were therefore vacated and used up for some of the 2006
&amp; 2007 intake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have not forgotten US censuses.&nbsp; The vast number of
Whitehouses in Maine and New Hampshire is a deterrent to complete indexing, but
I hope this year to make a start on a referencing file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term  referencing file  means a file which contains only
entries that relate to correspondents  trees and is therefore not a complete
record of all Whitehouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXTRA NEWS, 4TH FEBRUARY 2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1911 census will be released to the public, online and
indexed, during 2009, i.e. 2 to 3 years earlier than expected.&nbsp; The
National Archives has been encouraged to do this by a ruling of the Information
Commissioner in favour of a complainant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their project to improve
and digitise the official birth, death and marriage indexes has met with
technical problems.&nbsp; The new indexes are expected to start to become
available on line in early 2008 and to be completed in 2009.&nbsp; This means
that when the Family Records Centre moves to Kew in March 2008, some of the
indexes will be held at Kew in paper form and some will be on line. &nbsp;You
might think this a shambles, but I couldn t possibly comment !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One good thing from our viewpoint is that ages at death for
the years 1837 to 1865 will be given in the new, improved&nbsp; index.&nbsp; At
present my version of the GRO Deaths index sorts into two sets within each
forename, one set (1866   1911) with an age at death and calculated date of
birth and the other (1837   1865) without.&nbsp; Care is needed to realise this
and search both sets if necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A project to improve the quality of my 1871 West Midlands
census index for Whitehouses in Staffordshire is about half-completed, so I
have taken the opportunity to launch an updated version.&nbsp; Besides the many
corrections and re-interpretations, there are several additional households,
found by searching in the British Origins index.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FURTHER NEWS, 9TH FEBRUARY 2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am re-registering the Whitehouse one-name study with the
Guild of One-Name Studies, which means that I shall be answering all enquiries
and will register new correspondents at any
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE, 1ST JANUARY 2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last quarter of 2006 has been one of huge progress:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- completion of the &quot;1871 CEN OTHER&quot; census
database, the part that covers all other areas of England &amp; Wales, Isle of
Man and the Channel Islands, except London and the West Midlands</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- improvements in the &quot;1841 CEN OTHER&quot; census
database, the part that covers all other areas of England &amp; Wales Isle of
Man and the Channel Islands, except London and the West Midlands</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the quality control project for &quot;1861 CEN WMIDS&quot;
extended to cover the whole of the Kings Norton registration district (2119 to
2127).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition of the years 1884 to 1911 to the GRO (England
&amp; Wales) births index</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition of the years 1902 to 1911 to the GRO (England
&amp; Wales) deaths index</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition of the years 1902 to 1911 to the GRO (Scotland)
births and deaths entries</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- improvements in the GRO marriage index by the addition of
some more spouse names</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the Probate Grants index for 1858 to 1935 extended by 8
years to 1943</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition to the census databases of the WFHC reference
numbers of the remainder of those who registered in March 2006, plus some
existing correspondents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Basic set of records established</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been a great deal of work, but, at last, after just
over 5 years, I have established a basic set of records for the Whitehouse
surname.&nbsp; Births, deaths and marriage indexes for England &amp; Wales run
from 1837 to 1911 and for Scotland from 1855 to 1911.&nbsp; The England &amp;
Wales indexes run to nearly 39,000 names.&nbsp; The census records now extend
across the whole of England &amp; Wales, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands
for 1841 to 1871 (totalling over 34,000 lines of entry) and a draft for
Scotland is progressing alongside the Ancestry indexing project.&nbsp;
Extending the modern end of the probate index has been hard going, with just
extra 8 years (1936-1943) causing it to increase in size by a quarter.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>&quot;Surely they will reference my son.&quot; (Matthew
Chapter 21, misquoted)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is much still to do.&nbsp; Two &quot;referencing
files&quot; are in progress, one containing marriages before civil registration
began (pre- 1st July 1837 in England &amp; Wales) and the other containing 1881
census extracts.&nbsp; These files are different from the databases mentioned
above, because they contain ONLY entries that are relevant to correspondents'
trees, with (of course) the WFHC reference number.&nbsp; In 2007, the main
focus of my work will be to reference the trees of existing correspondents, in
the GRO marriages and the 1841 to 1871 census databases and in the two
referencing files.&nbsp; Of course, newcomers' trees will also be referenced,
as they come in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The referencing files will be made available on
the website when they have reached a meaningful size.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>GRO Births Index</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One never knows where trouble with these databases will
strike next.&nbsp; On looking for an Ernest Whitehouse in the WFHC GRO births
index database, I found that two entries were not sorting correctly in year
order.&nbsp; Fortunately, I knew where the problem must be - a space being
accidentally introduced at the end of a name.&nbsp; Excel regards spaces as
characters and thus considers Ernest followed by a space to be a different name
from Ernest without one.&nbsp; So, I have gone through the births, putting
right an alarming number of similar errors, along with a few instances of a
second forename being wrongly entered in the same column as the first.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oddly, the marriages and deaths were free of such errors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anyone out there does find mis-sorting, or, indeed, any
other kind of error, please tell me.&nbsp; Not reporting it is not considered
kindness ! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>GRO Marriages Index</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This index is amended frequently, as more spouse
information, dates, churches and correspondent references are added.&nbsp; The
present update is unusual, since an extra marriage has been added.&nbsp; It
relates to an entry in the official GRO Index showing a Mary Ann Whitehorse
marrying in the second quarter of 1838 in Dudley registration district.&nbsp;
It took errors by Ancestry to make me realise that Whitehouse can be indexed as
Whitehorse and this is what happened here.&nbsp; I located the marriage at
Tipton St. Martin.&nbsp; All the &quot;original order&quot; numbers from 71
onwards have been moved on by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Probate and GRO Death index improvements</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after the 1st January update, I introduced into the
Probate Grants 1858-1943 and GRO Deaths Index an extra column.&nbsp; In this
column, Calc Birth Yr., I have subtracted age at death from year at death, to
give an approximate year of birth.&nbsp; These indexes have been sorted first
by forename and then on the basis of this column.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because
of the way in which Excel sorts, entries in which the Calc Birth Yr. is a blank
space (there being no age at death to subtract) are shifted to the end, after
the years.  So, taking the GRO Deaths Index for instance, a search under the
forename John will show two series of entries, one with a registration year of
1866-1911 in which a birth year is given and one with a registration year
1837-1865 in which it is not.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Official probate index under trial</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a little secret for my readers, possibly an
&quot;exclusive&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Principal Probate Registry is
computerising its probate index - that's the index to grants of representation
(wills and administrations) in those heavy printed books and (from 1973)
microfiches at First Avenue House, High Holborn, London.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work is
proceeding backwards from recent times and has reached grants for the year
1951.&nbsp; The new index is on trial at First Avenue House, where it can be
used free of charge.&nbsp; Its big advantage is that it goes by date of
death.&nbsp; Imagine trying to find a grant for William Whitehouse of 22 Burton
Road, Dudley, who died in 1952.&nbsp; The administration took place in 1981
!&nbsp;&nbsp; Its disadvantages are that one can search only 4 years at a time
and that the details of the grant are shown as merely the page of the printed
book with a red line around the entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's clear that my
spreadsheet index has many advantages over the new official index.&nbsp; When
the new official index has made further progress, I shall be able to use it to
improve my index, by locating all the later grants of those who died in 1943 or
earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It will be interesting to see how the Registry plans to pay
for this computerisation.&nbsp; My guess is that the index will be free to use,
but that the cost of the documents will rise.&nbsp; This could be a good time
to buy a will ( 5 if requested in person,  8 by post).&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Ancestry - a bouquet</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To balance the Ancestry-bashing that has been a feature of
newsletters and CEN EXPLANATIONS, here's an instance where they did really
well.&nbsp; In the 1871 census of Durham, there's a family of Whitehouses in
Stranton.&nbsp; The forename of the youngest is a dreadful scrawl, partly
overwritten that looked to me like &quot;Cha Hy&quot;, short for Charles
Henry.&nbsp; I took my cue from the older son who was abbreviated to &quot;John
Ja&quot;.&nbsp; To my surprise, Ancestry rendered the name as
&quot;Matty&quot;, which it just might be with a big stretch of the
imagination.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was born in Sheffield, where there are
strangely few Whitehouses and by looking in the GRO Births Index, I was able to
identify a Matthew registered at the right time in Sheffield.&nbsp; Well done
Ancestry ! </p>

October 2006</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major visible events this last quarter are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- completion of the 1861 census database for all England,
Wales, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- partial checking of the West Midlands section of the above</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- extension of the 1841 census database to include Channel
Islands, Isle of Man and the whole of Scotland</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition to the census databases of the WFHC reference
numbers of many of those who registered in March</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Completing the 1861 census transcription</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About half of my genealogical energy this quarter has been
poured into getting the 1861 census database (sortable indexed transcript) to
what I call &quot;theoretical completion&quot;.&nbsp; This term means that I
have covered the whole of Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man.&nbsp; However, much of my database relies on looking up entries using
on-line indexes (Ancestry, 1837 On Line) and re-indexing.&nbsp; In practice,
neither of the starting indexes gives complete coverage of all Whitehouses when
searched under this name or common deviant spellings of it, so the fear is that
some Whitehouses have been missed by both.&nbsp; That's why the completion is
&quot;theoretical&quot;.&nbsp; Additionally, the 1861 census is notorious for
its &quot;gaps&quot; - returns that have got lost: Ancestry has published a
list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been using both the &quot;1837 On Line&quot; and the
&quot;Ancestry&quot; index.&nbsp; The 1837 OL index is significantly worse than
that of Ancestry.&nbsp; They usually list about the same number of
&quot;hits&quot;, but 1837 OL gives large numbers of false positives - that is
to say, what is indexed as &quot;Whitehouse&quot; frequently turns out to be
another name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for Yorkshire, 1837 OL listed 208 Whitehouse
and variants, Ancestry 202 under Whitehouse and Whithouse.&nbsp; However, 1837
OL gave 38 false positives and did not list many Whitehouses that were found in
Ancestry.&nbsp; It would be nice to think that 1837 OL was so useless that it
could be simply ignored.&nbsp; Regrettably, this is not the case.&nbsp; It does
yield a few entries that do not appear in Ancestry under Whitehouse or the more
obvious variants.&nbsp; Remarkably, it produced entries that I could not find
in Ancestry, even by putting in the correct piece and folio reference.&nbsp;
They simply weren't there, there being a gap of several folios in the return
that did not appear to have been filmed (9 Kidderminster Court, Salford:&nbsp;
RG9/2915 FO 36 SCH 191; 175-1/2 Upper Windsor St., Aston:&nbsp; RG9/2175 FO 122
SCH 173). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1837 On Line has recently produced indexes and images for
the 1841 and 1871 censuses, so it will be very instructive to see whether any
new entries result - but that has to take a much lower priority than other
things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>1861 census of West Midlands:&nbsp; errors and omissions
lead to new quality control project</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the West Midlands, my 1861 census database was originally
constructed largely from local indexes and trawling through microfilms without
any indexing aid.&nbsp; It has since been checked in Ancestry and 1837 On
Line.&nbsp; As a result of this, I discovered that two areas had I had not
covered:&nbsp; the Staffordshire part of Stourbridge Registration District
(Amblecote, Wordsley, Kingswinford, Pensnett, Brierley Hill - RG9/2068 to 2074)
and parts of south Warwickshire.&nbsp; Moreover, there have been many errors in
other places, I regret to say.&nbsp; They range from omissions during trawling
to wrong schedule, folio and even piece numbers.&nbsp; I have therefore
launched a &quot;quality control&quot; project to check the whole of the 1861
census of the West Midlands against images of the census entries and have so
far completed Birmingham, Aston, Meriden registration districts (pieces 2128 to
2190), the Sedgley and Dudley parts of the Dudley registration district (2046
to 2062), the Handsworth part of the West Bromwich registration district (2019
to 2021) and part of the Kings Norton registration district (2119 to
2125).&nbsp; These were the most vulnerable areas, as mostly they relied on
trawling.&nbsp; This exercise has resulted in a large number of corrections and
re-interpretations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Improving the 1841 census transcription</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's no question that the best index is that of
&quot;British Origins&quot;, but they have been working only on the 1841 and
1871 censuses and many counties have not yet appeared.&nbsp; In the last 6
months or so, Origins has added Cheshire, Shropshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire to the 1841 coverage. Originally, the WFHC
database for these counties had to be constructed from the Ancestry index,
because, at the time, there was no other.&nbsp; Recently, I have checked the Origins
indexes for these counties.&nbsp; For Cheshire the same hits occurred in
each.&nbsp; In Shropshire, excluding Halesowen, one extra household was found
in Origins, an entry that was particularly difficult to read.&nbsp; When it
came to Yorkshire, Ancestry yielded 36 households, all of which were found in
Origins. However, Origins turned up 12 extra households not in Ancestry.&nbsp;
Two of these were rejected as Waterhouse and Whitehead, in 7 of the others
Whitehouse was either clear or the best reading, leaving 3 that were genuinely
difficult to decipher but in which Whitehouse was a possibility.&nbsp; Thus, on
the most generous basis, 7 out of 43 Whitehouse households (one sixth) were not
indexed findably in Ancestry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When going through the Origins index for Lancashire (1841),
I found another instance of missed filming by Ancestry.&nbsp; At White Chapel,
Liverpool, HO 107/562 Book 1, Folio 4, the whole of page 1 was missed and this
contains a Whitehouse.  Even Origins is not entirely error-free.&nbsp; In the
1841 census of Halesowen it has made the spectacular blunder of indexing a
family of the name Disley under Whitehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sorry to have gone on for so long, but many researchers do
not realise just how bad some of the computerised indexes are.&nbsp; Thank
goodness that in the heart of the West Midlands, where most Whitehouses are to
be found,&nbsp; I have been able to use locally-generated name indexes for much
of the 1851, 1861 and 1871 census databases on this website.&nbsp; It is my aim
to produce the very best indexes that encompass all Whitehouses in the 1841 to
1871 censuses, using as many sources as I can.&nbsp; So, if you out there think
I have missed one (it has been known), please, please tell me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alas, not every local index is reliable.&nbsp; I was
delighted to come upon the &quot;Sheffield Indexers&quot; website, as they have
indexed the 1841 census and it showed two Whitehouse families.&nbsp; Alas, they
turned out to be Whitman and Whitham on the best reading.&nbsp; There is only
one Whitehouse in my database for the 1841 census of Sheffield and that one is
doubtful (Origins, Ancestry).&nbsp; This is quite a surprising result,
considering that the Whitehouses were typical of the urban poor, who would go
to large towns in search of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>1841 Scotland</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm pleased to report a positive development in Scotland,
where Ancestry have produced an index to the 1841 census.&nbsp; This is not yet
linked to any images.&nbsp; I have used this index, together with some
&quot;trawlings&quot; of my own plus a search in &quot;FreeCEN&quot; to
construct a draft database for the whole of Scotland.&nbsp; Among the Scottish
counties, Whitehouse is found mainly in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire and the
furthest north of the entries is of a farm just outside Perth, i.e. central
Scotland.&nbsp; The draft will be finalised when images are available free of
charge (which could take a long time).&nbsp;&nbsp; If any readers in Scotland
could help me, please do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Developments at the Family Records Centre, London</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things are stirring at the Family Records Centre in
London.&nbsp; It's an odd place, with The National Archives (TNA) hosting
census and some probate records on the first floor and the Office of National
Statistics (General Register Office) occupying the ground floor for the births,
marriages and deaths indexes.&nbsp; The government has cunningly cut the budget
of TNA, knowing very well that it can save money by moving the census
facilities to Kew.&nbsp; (For overseas readers, the TNA building at Kew is some
8 miles out of the centre of London and accessible by a rather slow tube or
train journey, followed by about 7 to 12 minutes walk).&nbsp; The move will
take place by the end of 2008.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's likely that the ONS will also leave the FRC building,
given the project to digitise the indexes (not before time).&nbsp; The birth,
marriage and death indexes will be completely revised, working from the
original records.&nbsp; Marriages will be cross-indexed for 1837 to 1911, a
huge boon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, some of the work done on the Whitehouse Marriage
Index on this website will be overtaken by the official records.&nbsp; Also,
the maiden name of the mother will be given in the birth index for all
years.&nbsp; What the ONS ought to be doing, of course, is linking the index to
images of the certificates and making them available on-line, but I'm afraid
that isn't planned to happen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Indexing of correspondents' interests</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to update you all on the situation.&nbsp; In March
2006, I opened the door to newcomers for the first time since October
2001.&nbsp; In all, there were 30 new trees to tackle, with the reference
numbers 112, 118, 159, 169, 230 and 415 to 439.&nbsp; (The lower numbers are
earlier numbers that have been vacated because the information provided by the
original correspondent was inadequate).&nbsp; All these new trees should have
been indexed for GRO marriages.&nbsp; If you think that yours hasn't been
indexed completely, please tell me !&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have progressed to a second stage in which I am going
through the new trees in numerical order and indexing them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) in the1841 to 1871 census of England &amp; Wales, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) in the 1881 census of England &amp; Wales and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c) in &quot;pre-GRO marriages&quot; (church marriages
before 1st September 1837) in England &amp; Wales.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will see (a) on the website, but databases for (b) and
(c) are still under construction.&nbsp; I still have 431 to 439 to do and wish
to apologise to those concerned for the delay.&nbsp; This task is being given
priority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I go through the files, I am ensuring that every new
correspondent has a tree which is recorded digitally and printed out.&nbsp; The
printed trees are being stored tidily and will ultimately be archived</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(printed to archive quality paper).&nbsp; The long-term
storage of family trees is an on-going problem, but my intention is to create
an archive in paper or digital form or both and deposit the trees in an
appropriate library.&nbsp; That is some years away.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some correspondents are producing very nice tidy trees, well
researched.&nbsp; Others are not and it is taking me many hours to process each
one, particularly if their genealogy is linked to that of an existing
correspondent.&nbsp; Some are absolutely clueless about how to produce a nice
tidy tree that prints to A4 paper (297 x 210 mm) - not exactly difficult.&nbsp;
A few have submitted pedigrees of many pages containing extraneous information
relating to other ancestral lines than Whitehouse.&nbsp; I shall have to take a
firmer line about this and refuse them.&nbsp; Genealogical programs don't help
a lot, unless they are printed in text form.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many people
use these programs to make &quot;drop line&quot; charts - that's the name for
the ones that start with the oldest ancestor at the top and have the youngest
ranging across the bottom of many landscape pages connected by huge horizontal
lines that extend so far that one has to tape, say, 10 pages together to make
any sense of them.&nbsp; There's an awful lot to be said in favour of the
&quot;tall tree&quot;, in which the oldest ancestor appears at the left hand
side of a portrait page.&nbsp; It's just a drop line chart turned through 90
degrees with the names re-arranged to the new horizontal, saving loads of
space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another problem is that many trees are
under-researched.&nbsp; Using just my own website and FreeBMD, I can often make
progress.&nbsp; That shouldn't happen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If correspondent 435 of &quot;Witchend&quot;, or her cousin
Jo, is reading this, your tree from William Whitehouse and Louisa Grainger who
married 27 March 1831 at Sedgley All Saints, does not contain all the names on
the census returns and so will have to be re-drawn.&nbsp; If you want the
re-drawn tree and my comments, please provide a stamped addressed envelope or
an e-mail address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been re-thinking my policy about the 1891 and 1901
census.&nbsp; Without help, there's no way I am going to have time to check
references supplied, still less begin another database.&nbsp; Of course, trees
should continue to show everyone born up to and including 1901, but that is as
far as I can go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Work in progress</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, I am giving priority to indexing
correspondents' trees, starting with 421 to 439.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall be working
on the 1871 census of areas other than London and the West Midlands, so as to
bring that to &quot;theoretical completion&quot;.&nbsp; This is an urgent task,
to enable me to proceed with further indexing of the census returns with
correspondent reference numbers.&nbsp; The 1871 work will be interspersed with
further checking of the 1861 census of the West Midlands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know that progress here is slow, but there is only one of
me and I do try to lead a normal life as well ! .&nbsp; If anyone would like to
help, I have a checking job that needs doing at the FRC in London.&nbsp; All
who contribute are publicly thanked on the website.</p>

2nd July 2006</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major visible events this quarter are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- completion of the 1841 census database with the aid of the
&quot;Ancestry&quot; index</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- getting 1861 other (other = everywhere except London and
the West Midlands) well under way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- moving to a new website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, I have failed to make significant progress in
adding WFHC reference numbers to the census databases and I apologise to those
who registered in March that I have been unable to do this yet for their
trees.&nbsp; Please bear with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here in the south east of England where I live, we have had
an exceptionally dry and sunny June.&nbsp; I have therefore been busy painting
the outside of the house and so genealogy has been at a standstill.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today it was 35.5 degrees Celsius (96 degrees Fahrenheit) in the sun.&nbsp; I
started painting with undercoat at 5.25 a.m. and put a coat of gloss on at 9.30
a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to report that the family is all well and my son
has just distinguished himself by completing his exams to qualify as an
actuary.&nbsp; He did about half the exams some years ago, gave up the idea of
qualifying and became an IT project manager.&nbsp; Seeing so many bright people
younger than him entering the IT field, he took the other half of the actuarial
exams.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the distractions of looking after 4 children, he
managed to get his head down and do the work.&nbsp; I am very proud of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those new to the WFHC will find much information in the
April newsletter, still available to download.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>QUARTERLY UPDATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been the most energetic quarter in the history of
my efforts to co-ordinate Whitehouse genealogy.&nbsp; From the website
viewpoint, the most notable achievements are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- the new GRO marriage index, with many more matches of
spouses to Whitehouses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- overhaul of all the indexes to get rid of the code system
for variants, v7, v12, v24 etc. and the&nbsp;&nbsp; abbreviations for
Registration Districts in the West Midlands</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- successful checks of the 1841 census for the West Midlands</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- addition of Northamptonshire to the 1841 census of other
areas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- opening of the WFHC to new correspondents after 4  years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- a clear way forward for the WFHC</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- decision to change my e-mail address and semi-encrypt it
to deter spammers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Away from the web, other things have been going on.&nbsp; At
last, I have digitised the Register of Correspondents.&nbsp; The public part of
this (names, but no contact details) will be put on the website later this
year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Work has been steaming ahead on the 1861 and 1871
census.&nbsp; I have now completed the whole of London for both years, as draft
paper slips.&nbsp; For 1861, I have used the &quot;Ancestry&quot; interface to
read the scans, while checking the results from the &quot;Ancestry&quot; index
against the 1837online index.&nbsp; Needless to say, each index gave results
that the other did not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1851 census has also made good progress on paper, with
the result that the whole of England &amp; Wales has been covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It gave me great pleasure to find that the Manchester &amp; Lancashire FHS have
re-transcribed the flood-damaged parts of the 1851 census of Manchester and a
few other towns in Lancashire. &nbsp;Some books were damaged by a flood in the
Public Record Office before they could be filmed.&nbsp; A UV light technique
was used to enhance the writing in the books.&nbsp; Several Whitehouse entries
were found. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Interesting things are happening with the 1841 census.&nbsp;
British Origins has been filming and indexing it, but their progress latterly
has been very slow.&nbsp; I have been keeping pace with it.&nbsp; Meanwhile
&quot;Ancestry&quot; have filmed it and have talked about going on-line with it
in a couple of months.&nbsp; Poor though the &quot;Ancestry&quot; indexes are,
they are a great deal better than none at all, so I am hopeful that it will not
be too long before I can complete the London area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All this means, of course, a great deal of keyboarding to
put these paper transcripts onto Excel spreadsheets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some moments of interest occurred in enhancing the GRO
Marriage Index.&nbsp; There are five marriages where the page numbers for the
groom and bride did not agree, differing by one digit.&nbsp; Protracted
correspondence with the GRO in Southport, Lancashire, failed to move the mean
so-and-sos to investigate and tell me which reference was wrong.&nbsp; They
would rather waste time thinking of ways to say &quot;no&quot; than spend a few
minutes doing it !&nbsp;&nbsp; So I did my Sherlock act and sorted it out for
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The GRO Marriage Index on the website now contains only the
correct numbers.&nbsp; However, I did manage to persuade them to agree to a
correct a homosexual marriage in the 4th quarter of 1903, where Harry or Henry
Whitehouse married James Wakelam.&nbsp; The Whitehouse was Amy.&nbsp; So my
website shows only the correct version.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regular readers of this website will notice the new file of
Non-GRO marriages, a sort of dustbin for any marriage that I could not find in
the GRO indexes.&nbsp; There used to be many more, but with the aid of FreeBMD
and a bit more imagination on my part, they have been reduced to 21.&nbsp; It
has been quite a revelation to me to discover that many marriages which I
thought had never reached the GRO did in fact arrive, but have been lying there
mis-indexed.&nbsp; Take, for example, the marriage of Mary Whitehouse to Thomas
Cartmail which is in the parish register of Walsall St. Matthew for 8th July
1838.&nbsp; There was no difficulty in identifying Mary in the GRO index, but
Thomas ?&nbsp; I tried Cartmale, Cartwail, Carpmail, Carpmael, Gartmail,
Cortmail .&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final act of desperation I tried Curtmail and there
it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even more diligent readers will notice the mysterious file
&quot;FREQUENCY &quot; on the annex website.&nbsp; This contains a slightly
revised version of a paper that I had published in 1998 and shows the frequency
of the name Whitehouse and various ways of measuring it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
been telling correspondents for some years that in the Dudley, Tipton and West
Bromwich areas it has the same frequency as does Williams in the whole of
England &amp; Wales, Williams being the 3rd commonest surname.&nbsp; In the
Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley areas, it is on a par with Smith and Jones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Writing of surname frequency, I wonder if anyone can explain
to me the mysterious website <a href="http://www.taliesin-arlein.net/names">www.taliesin-arlein.net/names</a>
.&nbsp; It is said to be a 1998 database of 270,000 surnames in England &amp;
Wales, the entry qualification for which is that there must be at least 5
entries of the name.&nbsp; It enables one to obtain a ranking for any given
surname.&nbsp; Whitehouse was ranked 459, with 15,893 entries.&nbsp; According
to the Nottinghamshire FHS Journal, Vol. 11 No. 5, October 2004, the database
comes from names of people registered with the National Health Service, but the
website does not say this.&nbsp; Births are continually added, but deaths are
not weeded out.&nbsp; Multiplying by 0.93 gives an estimate of the population
having the name. &nbsp;I'll be returning to this topic in a later newsletter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am afraid that all this bread-and-butter stuff (censuses,
GRO marriages) will disappoint those who are stuck around 1800 and hope that I
will conjure up some obscure records that will help them.&nbsp; I do have it
mind, but very few records identify Whitehouses in enough detail to be interesting.&nbsp;
I have downloaded the few Whitehouses, all in London, in the newly created
indexes to the Sun Fire Office registers for the period 1816 to 1834 and will
be adding these to the Annex website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The semi-encryption of my new e-mail address has caused some
comment.&nbsp; One defeated person sent a letter by post, another, sensibly,
did a Google search for the supermarket and worked it out.&nbsp; Of course, I
am sorry for any irritation and anyone who can offer me a nice free encryption
program that they have tested with Windows XP and can recommend will be
welcome.&nbsp; I have asked the Guild of One-name Studies to cancel my previous
address ending in &quot;one-name.org&quot;.&nbsp; Putting it on the website has
caused me no end of spam.&nbsp; I hope for better things from my new address
(see link on Index page).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been thinking of putting my telephone number on the
website, again in a semi-encrypted form, having discovered that it is the
product of two large prime numbers.&nbsp; However, I rather like my telephone
number and do not want to resort to elaborate arrangements to filter annoying
calls.&nbsp; So, I'll park that one, but any registered correspondent who would
like a telephone discussion can always e-mail me to request one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the successful influx of new correspondents, I now
have a big indexing task ahead of me and I hope that all such of you reading
this will be patient.&nbsp; Viv Turner (435) will have to be very patient, as
she didn't enclose a stamped addressed envelope or give an e-mail address with
her letter.&nbsp; I have registered her genealogy and indexed the marriages and
will write when I have completed the indexing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Existing correspondents who want to be very helpful should
please make a nice clear chart of their family history in the Whitehouse name,
which is NOT in a Gedcom format (send text or print and scan) and which is
printable to A4 in a neat and tidy presentation.&nbsp; Also wanted are census
references, including the 1881 census.&nbsp; References to family stories and
the 1891 and 1901 censuses should please be added as footnotes on the
chart.&nbsp; This is part of the &quot;clear way forward&quot;.&nbsp; I shall
be storing such charts in digital and printed-out form.&nbsp; Correspondence
will not be kept.&nbsp; Paper files will be disposed of.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some will recall having sent in &quot;Word pedigrees&quot;,
an idea that I was pursuing in my January 2002 paper in Journal of One-name
Studies.&nbsp; It was unsuccessful.&nbsp; Not many people responded.&nbsp; Many
mistakes were made, including several by me !&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, I saw
it as a temporary solution to a huge indexing problem.&nbsp; I always knew that
indexing marriages was the key to identifying genealogies and now that my GRO
marriage index has improved so much, it is even more true.&nbsp; I shall be
proceeding with the pre-civil registration marriages of correspondents as soon
as I can find the time.&nbsp; It would enable me to dispose of two shoe-boxes
of index cards, devoted entirely to spouses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the way, it is amazing just how many people do not
produce charts - some, it seems, find the task beyond them.&nbsp; I'll be
returning to this theme in a future newsletter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm pleased to say that my wife and I are well and that the
grandchildren suffer from only the usual passing colds and tummy bugs.&nbsp;
Robert, the only male, has been playing the organ and trombone at school, in
public, a terrific advance for a nervous child.&nbsp; Science is his thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>THE CENTRE IS OPENING AGAIN !</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>The Centre is opening again on a
limited basis, as explained below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>Firstly, it will re-open to admit
new registrations of Whitehouse genealogies for a period of one month only,
from 1st to 31st March 2006.&nbsp; As many of you know, the Centre has been
closed for over 4 years, since October 2001.&nbsp; The purpose of registering
is this, that you will then be given a WFHC number, which will be entered in
the census, marriage and probate indexes available on the web.&nbsp; This will
allow others with the same or a related genealogy to contact you, without your
being bothered by irrelevant enquirers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>Secondly, the Centre will open on
1st March and remain open indefinitely thereafter, for the purpose of making
contacts.&nbsp; It has been decided NOT to put addresses in an on-line
directory on the website, but that all contacts will be arranged through the
Centre.&nbsp; (This is a change from the arrangement set out in my 1st October
2005 newsletter).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is expected that most of the contacts will be
made in March or April 2006, because existing correspondents have already been
&quot;matched&quot; to each other.&nbsp; These contacts will be between a new
correspondent who registers in March and either another such new correspondent
or an existing one.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some existing correspondents will
probably have changed their contact details, so there might well be a time lag
of several months before some of the contacts can be arranged.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
is for this reason that the Centre will remain open for arranging contacts for
a long time after March 2006.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>After 31st March 2006, the Centre
will be closed for new registrations.&nbsp; When I have coped with the expected
flood of new registrations, I will consider whether to open again for
additional new registrations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>The Centre will remain closed for
casual enquiries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>The rules for new registrations
will be as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FUTURE PLANS OF THE WFHC</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to continue with quarterly newsletters on or about 1st
January, April, July and October</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to maintain the probate indexes, which are potentially of
enormous value</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to complete the 1841, 1851, 1861 and 1871 census indexes
for England &amp; Wales to a high standard of accuracy and improve coverage of
Scotland</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to annotate further the census, marriage and probate
indexes with the references of correspondents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to improve the GRO index files, especially for marriages
and to extend births and deaths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to index the marriages of correspondents which took place

<p class=MsoNormal>- to index the 1881 census references of correspondents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to create an on-web register of the names of
correspondents and an off-web register of their contact details</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- to index some of the US censuses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OTHER RECENT NEWS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been a tumultuous year in genealogy, owing to a big
increase in indexing on-line.&nbsp; There is so much that I would like to do to
improve my Whitehouse records, so little spare time in which to do it.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During much of 2005, I have been concentrating on expanding
my sortable indexed transcripts of the 1841 to 1871 censuses.&nbsp; I have
re-written the file CEN EXPLANATIONS, which shows the state of affairs to date.
There is one very important message that I want to get across.&nbsp; It is that
the &quot;Ancestry&quot; indexing of Whitehouses is of a very poor
standard.&nbsp; If you have failed to find your Whitehouse ancestor in
&quot;Ancestry&quot;, it's quite likely that he or she has been
mis-indexed.&nbsp; It's well worth trying my indexes on this website.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When using the &quot;Ancestry&quot; indexes, I am now
routinely searching Whit*, where * is a &quot;wild card&quot; representing one
or more characters.&nbsp; This search therefore picks up Whitacre, Whitcombe,
White, Whitehair, Whitehead, Whitehorne etc. along with Whitehouse.&nbsp; The
most worrying names are those which commonsense says are very unlikely, such as
&quot;Whitchoun&quot; and &quot;Whitchouse&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, I can't
check every entry thrown up by the Whit* search, but I do look at the image for
all those names which have been known to be mis-readings of Whitehouse or which
are highly improbable names of about the same length.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be nice to think that the Whit* search, although
very tedious, will guarantee my picking up all the Whitehouses.&nbsp; Alas,
some of the mis-readings do not begin with these four letters.&nbsp; A few are
so strange that no reasonable search in &quot;Ancestry&quot; would ever find
them.&nbsp; I am so glad, therefore, that a significant proportion of my census
records has come from local name indexes or trawling (reading through films,
unaided by any index).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another strength of my indexes lies in the place of
birth.&nbsp; I try hard to read this sensibly, frequently looking up the names
of villages and hamlets.&nbsp; Correspondent 097 will see what I mean, when I
mention that &quot;Ancestry&quot; have indexed her Alfred Whitehouse on the
1871 census as born in Waberthwaite, Surrey.&nbsp; Waberthwaite, if it existed
at all, would be a Lake District name.&nbsp; He was actually born in Walworth,
now an area of south east London, near the Elephant &amp; Castle and this is
reasonably clearly written in the census return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This does not mean that the &quot;Ancestry&quot; indexes are
useless.&nbsp; After all, they cover areas for which no local name indexes
exist.&nbsp; Trawling is never a reliable method and I am using on-line indexes
to check the accuracy of the trawls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people must wonder whether transcribing the whole
household, servants and all, is worthwhile.&nbsp; You just never know, as
correspondent 070 will testify, because the future wife of Robert Stephen
Whitehouse, the cotton mercer, can be found listed among the very many
apprentices and servants in the 1871 census of his establishment in Leamington
Spa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the immediate future, a priority is to continue keeping
pace with the &quot;British Origins&quot; indexing of the 1841 census.&nbsp;
This has been proceeding slowly, working roughly diagonally across southern and
middle England, from Cornwall to Lincolnshire, with new counties being added
every month or two.&nbsp; The quality of the &quot;British Origins&quot;
indexing is high.&nbsp; They have covered the three counties of the West
Midlands, where most Whitehouses are found.&nbsp;&nbsp; The WFHC index to the
1841 census of the West Midlands was compiled partly from local indexes and
partly from trawling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have started using the &quot;British
Origins&quot; index to check the trawled parts for omissions and have so far
completed Dudley and Sedgley parishes.&nbsp; (There were several omissions, as
expected).&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The WFHC index to the 1851 census has benefited from
published paper or fiche surname indexes, with only a very little
trawling.&nbsp; However, the CEN OTHER file (covering everywhere except the
West Midlands and London) is weak in places, so I have made a start on
supplementing that by using the &quot;Ancestry&quot; indexes.&nbsp; The worst
areas are probably Yorkshire and Kent, so I have started there and will be
up-grading that file in the first quarter of 2006.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another priority is to improve the GRO Marriage Index.&nbsp;
This is a big task, for the idea is to include churches where the marriage took
place and the date.&nbsp; Also, there are many more spouse names to add.  This
improved index will be an immensely powerful tool, for it will enable searchers
either to find the marriage or to eliminate a large number of possibilities
from their list of candidates.&nbsp; Currently, 1837 to 1881 has been completed.&nbsp;
1902 to 1911 is also available in this form, but some additions are in the
pipeline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You'll have seen WFHC references in the last column of the
census transcripts.&nbsp; Only a small portion of these has resulted from any
systematic attempt at entering them.&nbsp; I intend to start going through the
paper files in an organised way, marking up the digital files with
references.&nbsp; This will be an ongoing project during 2006, but it is a huge
task.&nbsp; Therefore, any registered correspondent who wants to help by
pointing out where his or her reference is missing and needs to be inserted in
the digital files (census, marriage, probate) will be very well
received.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please also contribute 1881 census references, as I shall
shortly be establishing a file for those.&nbsp; I need at least the piece and
folio number.&nbsp; </p>
