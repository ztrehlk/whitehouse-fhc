color:black;layout-grid-mode:line'>Briefly, the Legacy Duty Act of 1796
invented a new form of taxation to pay for national defence against a French
invasion.&nbsp; From 1796 to 1805, legacy duty was payable only on personal
estate (money, goods etc.) and not on real estate (property or leases of
property).&nbsp; It was payable only on legacies and residues of the estate
over  20 and only when the beneficiaries were not spouses, children, parents or
grandparents of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are thus few entries in the
registers for that period.&nbsp; The 1805 Legacy Duty Act limited the excepted
beneficiaries to spouses and parents.&nbsp; It also included property which the
will directed should be sold to raise money for legacies or the residue of the
estate.&nbsp; The  20 limit of exemption remained.&nbsp; From 1815 to 1853,
parents were removed from the exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the result, most
estates were dutiable from 1815 onwards.&nbsp; The Succession Duty Act of 1853
changed the law to catch virtually all estates worth over  100, regardless of
whether it was personal or real property, although bequests to spouses continued
to be exempted.&nbsp; Legacy duty continued alongside it.</span></p>

to genealogists lies mainly in the fact that they cover the whole of England

index, the EDO records still have a value, particularly in giving a date of
death that might not be available from the probate or administration

interest to the widow and subsequently sold, sometimes result in information

that can be awkward to find, a film folio number has been added.&nbsp; The
number that precedes the page and is separated by a comma as in, for instance

The index has been further enhanced by the addition of a column in which the
date of birth of the deceased is calculated by subtracting age at death from
the date of death.&nbsp; The file on the website is sorted by (1) Forenames of
the deceased Whitehouse, (2) Date of grant, (3) Database reference (PR .....)
and (4) Number (see below for explanations).&nbsp; I have abandoned a previous
sorting order, by using the date of grant in place of calculated year of birth,
having found this to be more convenient, but, of course, it could be re-sorted
in moments, as desired.  Some ages at death cannot be matched up with certainty
(without a death certificate):&nbsp; if there are two possibilities close
together in age, then I have taken an average and used that to calculate the
year of birth, because ages at death are frequently a few years wrong anyway.</span></p>

look through the whole range of a particular forename, remembering (a) that
some deceased have no calculated date of birth, because the age of death is not
known (this applies even in and after 1866 - war deaths normally have no age at
death, for example) <u>or</u> the calculated date of birth is ambiguous <u>or</u>
the age at death is given inaccurately and (b) that if the person has a second
forename, he will be sorted after the single forename entries, regardless of
his calculated birth year.&nbsp; While this could take a little time, it is one
of the huge advantages of a spreadsheet over having to enter particulars in
search boxes that one can view the remoter possibilities very easily, thus
increasing the chance of finding an official entry which contains a mistake or
is not at the date which you thought it ought to be.&nbsp; Once again, do bear
in mind that some grants take place many years after death.</span></i></p>

abbreviation &quot;HU&quot; is used to indicate this.&nbsp; In the earlier
years, the widow of a deceased husband is described in the Principal Probate
Registry index as the widow and relict (WI &amp; RT), but this practice stopped

mean widow of the deceased.</span></p>
